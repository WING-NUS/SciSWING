TODO: Caching json data based on input corpus. This is should be retrievable as
well. Most scripts should be able to retrieve from the cache however this
should only be uni directional.
If the input corpus is cached, the script will retrieve data that is necessary
for its processing. If not or if the right extent of data is not cached, then
the pipeline needs to be manually run. (Should default pipeline be initiated?)
