      <bodyText confidence="0.999937214285714">
This paper describes PEGASUS, a spoken language inter-
face for on-line air travel planning that we have recently devel-
oped. PEGASUS leverages off our spoken language technology
development in the ATIS domain, and enables users to book
flights using the American Airlines EAASY SABRE system. The
input query is transformed by the speech understanding sys-
tem to a frame representation that captures its meaning. The
tasks of the System Manager include transforming the seman-
tic representation into an EAASY SABRE command, transmit-
ting it to the application backend, formatting and interpreting
the resulting information, and managing the dialogue. Pre-
liminary evaluation results suggest that users can learn to
make productive use of PEGASUS for travel planning, although
much work remains to be done.

INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
      <bodyText confidence="0.9995418">
Over the past few years, our group has participated,
as a member of the ARPA Human Language Technology
(HLT) research community, in the development of spo-
ken language technology in the common domain called
Air Travel Information Service, or ATIS [1]. ATIS permits
users to verbally query for air travel information, such as
flight schedules from one city to another, obtained from
a small relational database excised from the Official Air-
line Guide. By requiring that all system developers use
the same database, it has been possible to compare the
performance of various spoken language systems based
on their ability to extract the correct information from
the database, using a set of prescribed training and test
data, and a set of interpretation guidelines. Indeed, pe-
riodic common evaluations have occurred at regular in-
tervals, and steady performance improvements have been
observed for all systems [2, 3, 4].
While the ATIS task has been instrumental in the de-
velopment of technologies that can understand sponta-
neously generated verbal queries in a limited domain, it

does have some shortcomings. First, the current com-
mon evaluation focuses on the correctness of the infor-
mation extracted from the database without any regard
to the system's side of the interchange (e.g., clarifica-
tion queries and helpful suggestions). Thus it has the
effect of discouraging research on dialogue-based systems
which, we believe, is a crucial aspect of human com-
puter interactions. Second, ATIS makes use of a mock-up,
static database containing flight and fare information for
a small set of cities within the United States and Canada.
It is not a realistic model of the databases actually be-
ing used by travel agents and travellers. In particular,
operational flight information systems are much larger
and more complex, and, most importantly, they contain
information which is dynamic in nature.
The rapid technological progress that we are witness-
ing gives us hope that spoken language systems capable
of performing real tasks will begin to emerge within the
decade. To realize this potential, however, it is impor-
tant that we begin to develop the technology using real
databases, so that we can uncover limitations and gaps in
our present research paradigm. To this end, we started
in 1992 to investigate the feasibility of attaching a spo-
ken language interface to an available on-line database.
We selected the American Airlines EAASY SABRE system,
which allows subscribers to obtain flight information and
make flight reservations via a large dynamic database,
accessed through their personal computers over the tele-
phone line. This system currently has over 700,000 ac-
tive subscribers, most of whom are travellers, not travel
agents. We selected this database mainly because we be-
lieve we can leverage off of our existing Nris system to
build an appropriate user-friendly interface.
To communicate with EAASY SABRE in its normal
mode of operation, users issue coded queries specifying
restrictions such as source, date, and fare code. If the
necessary pieces of information are omitted from the query,
the system enters a tightly controlled menu protocol to
fill them in. What we have attempted to accomplish is a
replacement of this cumbersome interface with something
that permits a more natural dialogue with the computer.
Our system, called PEGASUS, acts as a mediator between

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We
first describe the PEGASUS system, paying particular at-
tention to the conversion of the parse tree to a semantic
representation and the multiple roles played by the Sys-
tem Manager, mediating between the user and the EAASY

ment aspects of the system in some detail. This is fol-

Figure 1 shows a block diagram of PEGASUS. The
speech understanding component makes use of much of
the original ATIS system to process user queries [5, 6].
The segment-based SUMMIT speech recognition compo-
nent [7] produces a list of the top ten sentence hypothe-
ses, which are then filtered by the probabilistic TINA
natural language component [8]. The particular version
of TINA employs a robust parsing strategy [9] that at-
tempts to piece together parsable fragments, which is
often necessary for spontaneous speech containing dis-
fluencies. A semantic frame representation is used to
encode the meaning efficiently. The entire speech under-
standing system, with a working vocabulary of approx-
imately 1300 words, performs in near real-time using a
high-end workstation with no additional hardware. As
for its performance, our ATIS system achieved the second
lowest error rate for both text and speech input in the
last two annual ARPA spoken language systems common
evaluations measuring the systems' ability to extract rel-
evant information from the database [3, 4]. In the most
recent evaluation, our system achieved an error rate of
12.5% and 14.2% on all answerable queries, when the
transcription and the speech signal were provided as in-
put, respectively.

Meaning Representation
</subsectionHeader>
      <bodyText confidence="0.999965294117647">
Through our previous experience in developing spo-
ken language systems, we have learned that simplicity
of form is an important principle in building effective
meaning representations. Our view on the appropriate
structural units of a semantic frame has evolved over
time. Our present view is that all major constituents
in a sentence can be classified as one of only three dis-
tinct categories, which we label as [clause], [topic], and
[predicate]. Thus, verbs, adjectives, prepositions and
modifier nouns are all considered to be predicates. Fur-
thermore, grammatical constituents such as &amp;quot;subject&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;direct object&amp;quot; are not explicitly marked in the se-
mantic frame. We have applied this new formalism suc-
cessfully across several languages in our VOYAGER do-
main [10], and we are also using it in PEGASUS. An ex-
ample semantic frame for the sentence, &amp;quot;Is there a United
flight connecting in Denver,&amp;quot; is shown in Figure 2.

      <bodyText confidence="0.999971769230769">
During the design phase of our project, we made a
commitment not to alter the interface and protocols of
EAASY SABRE. We see no benefit, nor do we feel compe-
tent, in making changes to a proven system used by many
users. In fact, PEGASUS'S interface to EAASY SABRE is
identical to that of a user on a PC or a travel agent —
EAASY SABRE cannot distinguish between a user speaking
a natural utterance (such as &amp;quot;I want to go from Boston
to San Francisco on October 21&amp;quot;) or typing to the system
in cryptic codes (such as /schedule,BOS,SF0,210CT,1).
Thus the first task of the System Manager is to transform
the semantic frame into the appropriate EAASY SABRE
command. When necessary, the System Manager en-
gages in a clarification dialogue with the user until enough
information is available to construct a complete EAASY
SABRE command, thus preempting EAASY SABRE'S orig-
inal menu-based clarification protocol.
In response to a command, EAASY SABRE generally
returns both formatted tables and additional options avail-
able by menu selection (such as &amp;quot;5: Show Seat Assign-
ment&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;12: Show more flights&amp;quot;). The data stream (i.e.,
raw text) returned from EAASY SABRE must be parsed,
filtered, and reformatted by the System Manager for dis-
play to the user. The tables and menu options extracted
from the database are temporarily stored in a local cache.
Menu options are selectively made available to the user,
thus allowing the system, for example, to map a user's
explicit request for seat assignment into the appropriate
menu key. Tables can be postprocessed to apply con-
straints beyond those available through EAASY SABRE,
such as &amp;quot;serving dinner,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;nonstop,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;leaving in the
afternoon.&amp;quot;
In addition to providing the displays, the System Man-
ager also provides a paraphrase of the relevant informa-
tion. Some users have found this feature to be extremely
beneficial to help detect the system's understanding er-
rors. The user can also type natural language queries to
PEGASUS, an appropriate action when speech recognition
errors persist.

DIALOGUE MANAGEMENT
</sectionHeader>
      <bodyText confidence="0.999959696969698">
Before discussing the dialogue management aspects
of PEGASUS, we thought it would be instructive to ex-
amine the log of an actual round-trip booking, shown in
Figure 3. In this example, one of the authors used PEGA-
SUS to make a reservation in order to attend a workshop
in the San Francisco area. Like a travel agent, PEGASUS
needs to know the source, destination, and date before
it can provide the flight information. The user utilized
additional constraints to narrow down the choices before
settling on a particular flight. It took two exchanges to
arrive at the appropriate fare, and three more to book the
return flight. The entire booking took nine exchanges,
and lasted approximately 5 minutes. Note that a large
fraction of the time is spent waiting for EAASY SABRE to
respond.
The dialogue component of PEGASUS is significantly
more complicated than that of the original ATIS sys-
tem [11]. This is in large part due to the fact that it must
monitor not only the user's dialogue state and the degree
of completion of the booking, but also the state of the
EAASY SABRE system. For instance, it must preprocess
fare restrictions, warning the user of limits imposed on
return dates for restricted fares, screening selected fares
for possible constraint failure, and confirming availabil-
ity on selected flights before attempting to issue book-
ings. Otherwise, the EAASY SABRE system would invoke
a complex subdialogue which we wish to avoid.
The system keeps a record of the most recently dis-
played sets of flights and fares, as well as a ticket frame
where slots (e.g., fare class) are periodically updated
upon user specification. This information is also dis-
played to the user as a ticket. The system must con-
sult all of these sources of information in addition to the
user's queries in deciding its next move.
The dialogue is managed as a set of more than thirty
distinct dialogue states. Any particular dialogue exchange
consists of a response phase followed by an initiative
phase. During the response phase, the system may have
to consult the dialogue state to properly interpret the
query. For instance, there are several different states that
can provoke a &amp;quot;yes/no&amp;quot; response, and the system must
also be prepared for the user not to comply, but instead to
ask a completely independent question. While process-
ing the user's query the system may need to update the
dialogue state, and upon completing the response phase
it consults the state to determine what if any initiative
action is appropriate at this time.
There are several meta-level commands that have led
to a more usable system. A request for help can be
issued at any time, and the response it invokes is de-
pendent upon the current state of the dialogue. For in-
stance, at the very beginning of a dialogue, a request for
help causes the system to provide an organized list of
the cities it knows. There are also two meta-level com-
mands that erase previous information. A &amp;quot;scratch that&amp;quot;
command causes the system to erase the preceding query
from context, restoring the discourse content to its for-
mer state. In the event that this query involved a booking
request, the system must also issue a cancellation request
to EAASY SABRE. The &amp;quot;scratch that&amp;quot; capability is par-
ticularly valuable to recover from damaging recognition
errors. A more drastic &amp;quot;clear history&amp;quot; command allows
the user to start completely afresh. We feel that the
availability of these erasure commands allows the system
to be more aggressive in taking action, without having
to repeatedly ask for confirmation of user requests.

</sectionHeader>
      <bodyText confidence="0.999959254901961">
PEGASUS first came into being in January 1993. Since
then, we have been actively improving and extending its
capabilities. Thus the system is in a constant state of flux
— deficiencies are corrected as new capabilities are intro-
duced. Nevertheless, it is fully functional in the sense
that members of our group have been able to use it to
make actual travel arrangements since last spring, using
naturally spoken English. Even though it is definitely
premature to accurately assess the usefulness of the sys-
tem, we have recently begun to formally monitor its per-
formance longitudinally by keeping a time-stamped log
file of all transactions. In this section, we will present
some very preliminary results on the system's perfor-
mance since early fall, 1993. The results are obtained
from ten bookings made by eight members of our group
in order to satisfy their real travel needs. All of them rep-
resented round-trip bookings from one city to another. In
some cases, the time for travel was important whereas in
others, the cheapest airfare was desired. Seven of the ten
bookings were successfully completed. Statistics on some
of the objective measures for the successfully completed
bookings are shown in Table 1.
Averaged across all six subjects who completed the
bookings successfully, it took almost 25 queries and more
than 13 minutes for the subjects to complete a booking.
It is interesting, however, to compare the statistics of the
three experienced users2 with the other three, who were
using the system for the first time. Compared to the
naive users, the experienced users completed the book-
ings with considerably less effort — using less than one-
third of the number of queries and taking one-fourth the
amount of time. The variations in their performance are
also considerably less. In general, one can expect the sys-
tem's performance on totally naive subjects to degrade.
On the other hand, the results give us hope that experi-
enced travellers can learn to put PEGASUS to productive
use, once they become familiar with its capabilities.
We also examined the log files for the three unsuc-
cessful bookings in order to identify the system's short-
comings. In one case, the user successfully completed
the forward leg of a trip, but the system booked an erro-
neous return leg, causing him to start over. He cleared
the discourse history, but did not explicitly cancel the
booking on EAASY SABRE. Thus, even though the user
successfully booked the flights he wanted, EAASY SABRE
was unable to reconcile the double booking on the for-
ward leg. In the second case, the user initially selected
a, fare that was incompatible with his travel plans. He
did not successfully cancel his initial reservation or clear
the discourse history. The, system continued to enforce
the restrictions on the previous fare, even though he at-

tempted to rebook with an unrestricted fare. In the third
case, the discount fare selected for the forward leg was
not available on the return flight. Both the second and
third users eventually gave up in frustration.
Since mid January, we have begun to save the speech
waveform, in addition to the log-file. We were thus able
to also measure the system's speech recognition perfor-
mance. The word and sentence recognition error rates
for these bookings were found to be 10.6% and 28.6%,
respectively.

DISCUSSION AND
FUTURE PLANS
</sectionHeader>
      <bodyText confidence="0.999960240506329">
This paper describes our recent effort in developing a
spoken language interface to an on-line, dynamic airline
reservation system. By leveraging off our ATIS develop-
ment effort and paying particular attention to dialogue
management, we were able to produce a working inter-
face that enables users to make real flight bookings using
spoken language.
PEGASUS is the outcome of a new research strat-
egy that we have adopted, one that strives to develop
language-based technologies within the context of real
application back-ends, rather than relying on mock-ups,
however realistic they might be. We believe that this
strategy will force us to confront some of the critical tech-
nical issues that may otherwise elude our attention, such
as dialogue modelling and new word detection/learning.
We also believe that the time is ripe for us to begin
demonstrating the usefulness of these technologies. Work-
ing on real applications thus has the potential benefit of
shortening the interval between technology demonstra-
tion and its ultimate use. Besides, real applications that
can help people solve problems will be used by real users,
thus providing us with a rich and continuing source of
useful data.
While we are encouraged by our initial success with
PEGASUS, much work remains to be done. One of the
major deficiencies of the system is its inability to grace-
fully coerce the user back on track when his/her request
cannot be satisfied. A common problem arises when the
cheapest fare that the user specified is not available on
the selected return flight. The user is faced with the mul-
tiple choices of modifying his/her choice for the flight,
date, or fare. Rather than leaving the user to explore all
these dimensions freely and run the risk of confusion, a
more productive solution may be for the system to take
control of the dialogue by offering explicit choices. Of
course, the user should still be free to diverge from the
computer's goal whenever he/she so chooses.
Until very recently, the system's knowledge has been
limited to fewer than sixty major cities in North America,
Europe, and Japan. We have just expanded PEGASUS'S
knowledge base to more than 220 major cities worldwide.
Nevertheless, it is still a very small set considering that
EAASY SABRE contains flight information for nearly two
thousand cities worldwide. Rather than making all the
cities, airports, and airlines available with equal proba-
bility at all times, we will explore ways to constrain the
search while maintaining full flexibility. One possibility
is to allow a user to customize the system to suit their
needs. Thus, for example, a user could specify the cities
and airlines that they care about, in. much the same way
they presently specify their frequent flyer number, seat-
ing preferences, and credit card information for billing.
The system will need to be supplemented with tools that
will enable users to interactively and incrementally add
appropriate information. In addition, the system could
also automatically adjust language probabilities based on
the user's dialogue history.
At the moment, the system can only book a single
seat under the name of the user currently logged onto
EAASY SABRE. In the future, we would like to add the
capability of changing the name on the ticket, or booking
multiple tickets for the user and accompanying family
members, for example.
The present implementation of PEGASUS assumes that
information is provided to the user both visually and au-
rally. This assumption obviously affects significantly the
nature of the responses generated by PEGASUS. For ex-
ample, the system will currently say, &amp;quot;Here are the flights
from Boston to San Francisco on October 20,&amp;quot; and pro-
ceed to display them. We believe that there will be many
occasions in which a user may be communicating with
the system by telephone. In such a case, the information
must be presented in a different manner (e.g., &amp;quot;There
are seventeen direct flights from Boston to San Fran-
cisco on October 20.&amp;quot;) The resulting human-computer
dialogue will be quite different from that in our current
implementation. We intend to pursue such a &amp;quot;display-
less&amp;quot; implementation in the future, eventually leading to
the development of telephone-based applications.

Our experience in designing PEGASUS has led us to
the realization that considerable care must go into pro-
viding mechanisms to easily manage and maintain dia-
logue coherence. While our dialogue states are a conve-
nient representation, the current mechanism for control-
ling them is becoming unwieldy, and therefore needs to
be reorganized prior to adding some of the enhancements
mentioned here.
Through our experience in developing a preliminary
version of PEGASUS, we discovered that the capability to
specify the dialogue flow explicitly at some high level is
necessary, in order to be able to understand and manage
the dialogue effectively. To that end, we recently re-
designed the PEGASUS control strategy, so that dialogue
moves conditioned on prior states can be conveniently
specified in tabular form.
An example entry from our newest implementation
is shown in Table 2. This entry states that when the
user has just completed a successful booking, the system
should examine the conditions in the order presented and
take the appropriate action when they are met, setting
the dialogue state to the new value, if appropriate. Thus,
in our example, once a flight has been booked, the first
thing the system does is check to see if there is a first-leg
flight associated with the current one (i.e., &amp;quot;Has-first-
leg?&amp;quot;). If so, the system performs the actions associated
with concluding a booking (e.g., summarizing the flight
information) and resets the dialogue state to anticipate
a completely new exchange. If the first condition is not
met, the system proceeds in the same manner through
the others in the order given.
Ultimately, we would like a dialogue framework that
is domain independent. We have begun to define a dialogue-
description language in which different types of user in-
teractions can be represented. The terminal nodes of the
grammar would be associated with user query classes.
User interactions expected within a particular domain
would be described in this meta language, and that de-
scription would be used by the system to direct the hu-
man machine interaction.
There has been some theoretical work on the struc-
ture of human-human dialogue [12], but this has not yet
led to effective insights for building human-machine in-
teractive systems. We believe it should be possible to
define a hierarchy of dialogue types: for example, the air
travel dialogue is an instance of a more general trans-
action dialogue in which the user acquires information
about the choices available, commits to a purchase, per-
haps authorizes payment, and verifies the entire transac-
tion. It should be possible to compile a domain-specific
dialogue model from a general transaction dialogue frame-
work and a description of the particular sub-domain.

      <abstract confidence="0.9959326">This paper describes PEGASUS, a spoken language interface for on-line air travel planning that we have recently developed. PEGASUS leverages off our spoken language technology development in the ATIS domain, and enables users to book flights using the American Airlines EAASY SABRE system. The input query is transformed by the speech understanding system to a frame representation that captures its meaning. The tasks of the System Manager include transforming the semantic representation into an EAASY SABRE command, transmitting it to the application backend, formatting and interpreting the resulting information, and managing the dialogue. Preliminary evaluation results suggest that users can learn to make productive use of PEGASUS for travel planning, although much work remains to be done.</abstract>
