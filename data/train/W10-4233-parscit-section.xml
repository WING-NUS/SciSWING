We describe the second installment of the

Virtual Environments (GIVE-2), a shared
task for the NLG community which took
place in 2009-10. We evaluated seven
NLG systems by connecting them to 1825

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999972711538462">
This paper reports on the methodology and results
of the Second Challenge on Generating Instruc-
tions in Virtual Environments (GIVE-2), which
we ran from August 2009 to May 2010. GIVE
is a shared task for the NLG community which
we ran for the first time in 2008-09 (Koller et al.,
2010). An NLG system in this task must generate
instructions which guide a human user in solving
a treasure-hunt task in a virtual 3D world, in real
time. For the evaluation, we connect these NLG
systems to users over the Internet, which makes
it possible to collect large amounts of evaluation
data cheaply.
While the GIVE-1 challenge was a success, in
that it evaluated five NLG systems on data from
1143 game runs in the virtual environments, it
was limited in that users could only move and
turn in discrete steps in the virtual environments.
This made the NLG task easier than intended; one
of the best-performing GIVE-1 systems generated
instructions of the form “move three steps for-
ward”. The primary change in GIVE-2 compared
to GIVE-1 is that users could now move and turn
freely, which makes expressions like “three steps”
meaningless, and makes it hard to predict the pre-
cise effect of instructing a user to “turn left”.
We evaluated seven NLG systems from six in-
stitutions in GIVE-2 over a period of three months
from February to May 2010. During this time,
we collected 1825 games that were played by
users from 39 countries, which is an increase of
over 50% over the data we collected in GIVE-
1. We evaluated each system both on objec-
tive measures (success rate, completion time, etc.)
and subjective measures which were collected by
asking the users to fill in a questionnaire. We
completely revised the questionnaire for the sec-
ond challenge, which now consists of relatively
fine-grained questions that can be combined into
more high-level groups for reporting. We also in-
troduced several new objective measures, includ-
ing the point in the game in which users lost
or cancelled, and an experimental “back-to-base”
task intended to measure how much users learned
about the virtual world while interacting with the
NLG system.
Plan of the paper. The paper is structured as fol-
lows. In Section 2, we describe and motivate the
GIVE-2 Challenge. In section 3, we describe the
evaluation method and infrastructure. Section 4
reports on the evaluation results. Finally, we con-
clude and discuss future work in Section 5.

2 The GIVE Challenge
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997813642857143">
GIVE-2 is the second installment of the GIVE
Challenge (“Generating Instructions in Virtual En-
vironments”), which we ran for the first time in
2008-09. In the GIVE scenario, subjects try to
solve a treasure hunt in a virtual 3D world that they
have not seen before. The computer has a com-
plete symbolic representation of the virtual world.
The challenge for the NLG system is to gener-
ate, in real time, natural-language instructions that
will guide the users to the successful completion
of their task.
Users participating in the GIVE evaluation
start the 3D game from our website at www.
give-challenge.org. They then see a 3D

game window as in Fig. 1, which displays instruc-
tions and allows them to move around in the world
and manipulate objects. The first room is a tuto-
rial room where users learn how to interact with
the system; they then enter one of three evaluation
worlds, where instructions for solving the treasure
hunt are generated by an NLG system. Users can
either finish a game successfully, lose it by trig-
gering an alarm, or cancel the game. This result is
stored in a database for later analysis, along with a
complete log of the game.
In each game world we used in GIVE-2, players
must pick up a trophy, which is in a wall safe be-
hind a picture. In order to access the trophy, they
must first push a button to move the picture to the
side, and then push another sequence of buttons to
open the safe. One floor tile is alarmed, and play-
ers lose the game if they step on this tile without
deactivating the alarm first. There are also a num-
ber of distractor buttons which either do nothing
when pressed or set off an alarm. These distractor
buttons are intended to make the game harder and,
more importantly, to require appropriate reference
to objects in the game world. Finally, game worlds
contained a number of objects such as chairs and
flowers that did not bear on the task, but were
available for use as landmarks in spatial descrip-
tions generated by the NLG systems.
The crucial difference between this task and
the (very similar) GIVE-1 task was that in GIVE-
2, players could move and turn freely in the vir-
tual world. This is in contrast to GIVE-1, where
players could only turn by 90 degree increments,
and jump forward and backward by discrete steps.
This feature of the way the game controls were set
up made it possible for some systems to do very
well in GIVE-1 with only minimal intelligence,
using exclusively instructions such as “turn right”
and “move three steps forward”. Such instructions
are unrealistic – they could not be carried over to
instruction-giving in the real world –, and our aim
was to make GIVE harder for systems that relied
on them.

3 Method
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9997825">
Following the approach from the GIVE-1 Chal-
lenge (Koller et al., 2010), we connected the NLG
systems to users over the Internet. In each game
run, one user and one NLG system were paired up,
with the system trying to guide the user to success
in a specific game world.

3.1 Software infrastructure
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999997095238095">
We adapted the GIVE-1 software to the GIVE-2
setting. The GIVE software infrastructure (Koller
et al., 2009a) consists of three different mod-
ules: The client, which is the program which the
user runs on their machine to interact with the
virtual world (see Fig. 1); a collection of NLG
servers, which generate instructions in real-time
and send them to the client; and a matchmaker,
which chooses a random NLG server and virtual
world for each incoming connection from a client
and stores the game results in a database.
The most visible change compared to GIVE-1
was to modify the client so it permitted free move-
ment in the virtual world. This change further ne-
cessitated a number of modifications to the inter-
nal representation of the world. To support the de-
velopment of virtual worlds for GIVE, we changed
the file format for world descriptions to be much
more readable, and provided an automatic tool
for displaying virtual worlds graphically (see the
screenshots in Fig. 2).

Participants were recruited using email distribu-
tion lists and press releases posted on the Internet
and in traditional newspapers. We further adver-
tised GIVE at the Cebit computer expo as part of
the Saarland University booth. Recruiting anony-
mous experimental subjects over the Internet car-
ries known risks (Gosling et al., 2004), but we
showed in GIVE-1 that the results obtained for
the GIVE Challenge are comparable and more in-
formative than those obtained from a laboratory-

based experiment (Koller et al., 2009b).
We also tried to leverage social networks for re-
cruiting participants by implementing and adver-
tising a Facebook application. Because of a soft-
ware bug, only about 50 participants could be re-
cruited in this way. Thus tapping the true poten-
tial of social networks for recruiting participants
remains a task for the next installment of GIVE.

3.3 Evaluation worlds

<bodyText confidence="0.99998555">
Fig. 2 shows the three virtual worlds we used in the
GIVE-2 evaluation. Overall, the worlds were more
difficult than the worlds used in GIVE-1, where
some NLG-systems had success rates around 80%
in some of the worlds. As for GIVE-1, the three
worlds were designed to pose different challenges
to the NLG systems. World 1 was intended to be
more similar to the development world and last
year’s worlds. It did have rooms with more than
one button of the same color, however, these but-
tons were not located close together. World 2 con-
tained several situations which required more so-
phisticated referring expressions, such as rooms
with several buttons of the same color (some of
them close together) and a grid of buttons. Fi-
nally, World 3 was designed to exercise the sys-
tems’ navigation instructions: one room contained
a “maze” of alarm tiles, and another room two
long rows of buttons hidden in “booths” so that
they were not all visible at the same time.

After the GIVE-2 Challenge was publicized in
June 2009, fifteen researchers and research teams
declared their interest in participating. We dis-
tributed a first version of the software to these
teams in August 2009. In the end, six teams sub-
mitted NLG systems (two more than in GIVE-1);
one team submitted two independent NLG sys-
tems, bringing the total number of NLG systems
up to seven (two more than in GIVE-1). These
were connected to a central matchmaker that ran
for a bit under three months, from 23 February to
17 May 2010.

4 Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999917722222222">
We now report the results of GIVE-2. We start
with some basic demographics; then we discuss
objective and subjective evaluation measures. The
data for the objective measures are extracted from
the logs of the interactions; whereas the data for
the subjective measures are obtained from a ques-
tionnaire which asked subjects to rate various as-
pects of the NLG system they interacted with.
Notice that some of our evaluation measures are
in tension with each other: For instance, a sys-
tem which gives very low-level instructions may
allow the user to complete the task more quickly
(there is less chance of user errors), but it will re-
quire more instructions than a system that aggre-
gates these. This is intentional, and emphasizes
our desire to make GIVE a friendly comparative
challenge rather than a competition with a clear
winner.

4.1 Demographics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999857526315789">
Over the course of three months, we collected
1825 valid games. This is an increase of almost
60% over the number of valid games we collected
in GIVE-1. A game counted as valid if the game
client did not crash, the game was not marked as a
test game by the developers, and the player com-
pleted the tutorial.
Of these games, 79.0% were played by males
and 9.6% by females; a further 11.4% did not
specify their gender. These numbers are compa-
rable to GIVE-1. About 42% of users connected
from an IP address in Germany; 12% from the US,
8% from France, 6% from Great Britain, and the
rest from 35 further countries. About 91% of the
participants who answered the question self-rated
their English language proficiency as “good” or
better. About 65% of users connected from vari-
ous versions of Windows, the rest were split about
evenly between Linux and MacOS.

4.2 Objective measures
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999791214285714">
The objective measures are summarize in Fig. 3.
In addition to calculating the percentage of games
users completed successfully when being guided
by the different systems, we measured the time
until task completion, the distance traveled until
task completion, and the number of actions (such
as pushing a button to open a door) executed. Fur-
thermore, we counted how many instructions users
received from each system, and how many words
these instructions contained on average. All objec-
tive measures were collected completely unobtru-
sively, without requiring any action on the user’s
part. To ensure comparability, we only counted
successfully completed games.

duration: Time in seconds from the end of the tu-
torial until the retrieval of the trophy.

Fig. 4 shows the results of these objective mea-
sures. Task success is reported as the percent-
age of successfully completed games. The other
measures are reported as the mean number of sec-
onds/distance units/actions/instructions/words per
instruction, respectively. The figure also assigns
systems to groups A, B, etc. for each evaluation
measure. For example, users interacting with sys-
tems in group A had a higher task success rate,
needed less time, etc. than users interacting with
systems in group B. If two systems do not share
the same letter, the difference between these two
systems is significant with p &amp;lt; 0.05. Significance
was tested using a χ2-test for task success and
ANOVAs for the other objective measures. These
were followed by post-hoc tests (pairwise χ2 and
Tukey) to compare the NLG systems pairwise.
In terms of task success, the systems fall pretty
neatly into four groups. Note that systems D and
T had very low task success rates. That means
that, for these systems, the results for the other ob-
jective measures may not be reliable because they
are based on just a handful of games. Another
aspect in which systems clearly differed is how
many words they used per instruction. Interest-
ingly, the three systems with the best task success
rates also produced the most succinct instructions.
The distinctions between systems in terms of the
other measures is less clear.

system using a continuous slider. The slider posi-
tion was translated to a number between -100 and
100. Figs. 7 and 6 show the statements that users
were asked to rate as well as the results. These
results are based on all games, independent of the
success. We report the mean rating for each item,
and, as before, systems that do not share a letter,
were found to be significantly different (p &amp;lt; 0.05).
We used ANOVAs and post-hoc Tukey tests to test
for significance. Note that some items make a pos-
itive statement about the NLG system (e.g., Q1)
and some make a negative statement (e.g., Q2).
For negative statements, we report the reversed
scores, so that in Figs. 7 and 6 greater numbers are
always better, and systems in group A are always
better than systems in group B.
In addition to the items Q1–Q22, the ques-
tionnaire contained a statement about the over-
all instruction quality: “Overall, the system gave
me good directions.” Furthermore notice that the
other items fall into two categories: items that as-
sess the quality of the instructions (Q1–Q15) and
items that assess the emotional affect of the in-
teraction (Q16–Q22). The ratings in these cate-

summing over them. Fig. 5 shows the results for

4.4 Further analysis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978068285714286">
In addition to the differences between NLG sys-
tems, some other factors also influence the out-
comes of our objective and subjective measures.
As in GIVE-1, we find that there is a significant
difference in task success rate for different evalua-
tion worlds and between users with different levels
of English proficiency. Fig. 8 illustrates the effect
of the different evaluation worlds on the task suc-
cess rate for different systems, and Fig. 9 shows
the effect that a player’s English skills have on the
task success rate. As in GIVE-1, some systems
seem to be more robust than others with respect to
changes in these factors.
None of the other factors we looked at (gender,
age, and computer expertise) have a significant ef-
fect on the task success rate. With a few excep-
tions the other objective measures were not influ-
enced by these demographic factors either. How-
ever, we do find a significant effect of age on the
time and number of actions a player needs to re-
trieve the trophy: younger players are faster and
need fewer actions. And we find that women travel
a significantly shorter distance than men on their
way to the trophy. Interestingly, we do not find

In this paper, we have described the setup and re-
sults of the Second GIVE Challenge. Altogether,
we collected 1825 valid games for seven NLG sys-
tems over a period of three months. Given that this
is a 50% increase over GIVE-1, we feel that this
further justifies our basic experimental methodol-
ogy. As we are writing this, we are preparing de-
tailed results and analyses for each participating
team, which we hope will help them understand
and improve the performance of their systems.
The success rate is substantially worse in GIVE-
2 than in GIVE-1. This is probably due to the

harder task (free movement) explained in Sec-
tion 2 and to the more complex evaluation worlds
(see Section 3.3). It was our intention to make
GIVE-2 more difficult, although we did not antic-
ipate such a dramatic drop in performance. GIVE-
2.5 next year will use the same task as GIVE-2 and
we hope to see an increase in task success as the
participating research teams learn from this year’s
results.
It is also noticeable that players gave mostly
negative ratings in response to statements about
immersion and engagement (Q16-Q20). We dis-
cussed last year how to make the task more engag-
ing on the one hand and how to manage expecta-
tions on the other hand, but none of the suggested
solutions ended up being implemented. It seems
that we need to revisit this issue.
Another indication that the task may not be able
to capture participants is that the vast majority of
cancelled and lost games end in the very begin-
ning. To analyze at what point players lose or give
up, we divide the game into phases demarcated
by manipulations of buttons that belong to the 6-
button safe sequence. Fig. 10 illustrates in which
phase of the game players lose or cancel.
We are currently preparing the GIVE-2.5 Chal-
lenge, which will take place in 2010-11. GIVE-2.5
will be very similar to GIVE-2, so that GIVE-2
systems will be able to participate with only mi-
nor changes. In order to support the development
of GIVE-2.5 systems, we have collected a multi-
lingual corpus of written English and German in-
structions in the GIVE-2 environment (Gargett et
al., 2010). We expect that GIVE-3 will then extend
the GIVE task substantially, perhaps in the direc-
tion of full dialogue or of multimodal interaction.
Acknowledgments. GIVE-2 was only possible
through the support and hard work of a number of
colleagues, especially Konstantina Garoufi (who
handled the website and other publicity-related is-
sues), Ielka van der Sluis (who contributed to the
design of the GIVE-2 questionnaire), and several
student assistants who programmed parts of the
GIVE-2 system. We thank the press offices of
Saarland University, the University of Edinburgh,
and Macquarie University for their helpful press
releases. We also thank the organizers of Gener-
ation Challenges 2010 and INLG 2010 for their
support and the opportunity to present our results,
and the seven participating research teams for their
contributions.

We evaluated seven NLG systems by connecting them to 1825 users over the Internet, and report the results of this evaluation in terms of objective and subjective measures. 1 Introduction This paper reports on the methodology and results of the Second Challenge on Generating Instructions in Virtual Environments (GIVE-2), which we ran from August 2009 to May 2010. GIVE is a shared task for the NLG community which we ran for the first time in 2008-09 (Koller et al., 2010). An NLG system in this task must generate instructions which guide a human user in solving a treasure-hunt task in a virtual 3D world, in real time. For the evaluation, we connect these NLG systems to users over the Internet, which makes it possible to collect large amounts of evaluation data cheaply. While the GIVE-1 challenge was a success, in that it evaluated five NLG systems on data from 1143 game runs in the virtual environments, it was limited in that users could only move and turn in discrete steps in the virtual environments. This made the NLG task easier than intended; one of the be</context>

This feature of the way the game controls were set up made it possible for some systems to do very well in GIVE-1 with only minimal intelligence, using exclusively instructions such as “turn right” and “move three steps forward”. Such instructions are unrealistic – they could not be carried over to instruction-giving in the real world –, and our aim was to make GIVE harder for systems that relied on them. 3 Method Following the approach from the GIVE-1 Challenge (Koller et al., 2010), we connected the NLG systems to users over the Internet. In each game run, one user and one NLG system were paired up, with the system trying to guide the user to success in a specific game world. 3.1 Software infrastructure We adapted the GIVE-1 software to the GIVE-2 setting.
