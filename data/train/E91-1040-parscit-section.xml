I. INTRODUCTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999867039215686">
In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that the
limited size of existing computational lexicons and the
poverty of the semantic information they contain
represents one of the primary bottlenecks in the
development of realistic natural language processing
(NLP) systems. The need for extensive lexical and
semantic databases is evident in the recent initiation of a
number of projects to construct massive generic
lexicons for NLP (project GENELEX in Europe or
EDR in Japan).
The manual construction of large lexical-semantic
databases demands enormous human resources, and
there is a growing body of research into the possibility
of automatically extracting at least a part of the required
lexical and semantic information from everyday
dictionaries. Everyday dictionaries are obviously not
structured in a way that enables their immediate use in
NLP systems, but several studies have shown that
relatively simple procedures can be used to extract
taxonomies and various other semantic relations (for
example, Amster, 1980; Calzolari, 1984; Chodorow,
Byrd, and Heidorn, 1985; Markowitz, Ahlswede, and
Evens, 1986; Byrd et al., 1987; Nakarnura and Nagao,
1988; Vdronis and Ide, 1990i Klavans, Chodorow, and
Wacholder, 1990; Wilks et al., 1990).
However, it remains to be seen whether information
automatically extracted from dictionaries is sufficiently
complete and coherent to be actually usable in NLP
systems. Although there is concern over the quality of
automatically extracted lexical information, very few
empirical studies have attempted to assess it
systematically, and those that have done so have been
restricted to consideration of the quality of grammatical
information (e.g., Akkerman, Maserecuw, and Meijs,
1985). No evaluation of automatically extracted
semantic information has been published.
The authors would like to thank Lisa Lassck and Anne Gilman
for their contribution to this work.
In this paper, we report thc results of a quantitative
evaluation of automatically extracted semantic data. Our
results show that for any one dictionary, 55-70% of the
extracted information is garbled in some way. These
results at first call into doubt the validity of automatic
extraction from dictionaries. However, in section 4 we
show that these results can be dramatically reduced to
about 6% by several means--most significantly, by
combining the• information extracted from five
dictionaries. It therefore appears that even if individual
dictionaries are an unreliable source of semantic
information, multiple dictionaries can play an important
role in building large lexical-semantic databases.

2. METHODOLOGY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988419666666667">
Our strategy involves automatically extracting
hypernyms from five English dictionaries for a limited
corpus. To determine where problems exist, the
resulting hierarchies for each dictionary are compared to
an &amp;quot;ideal&amp;quot; hierarchy constructed by hand. The five
dictionaries compared were: the Collins English
Dictionary (CED), the Oxford Advanced Learner&amp;apos;s
Dictionary (OALD), the COBUILD Dictionary, the
Long man&amp;apos;s Dictionary of Contemporary English
(LDOCE) and the Webster&amp;apos;s 9th Dictionary (W9).
We begin with the most straightforward case in order to
determine an upper bound for the results. We deal with
words within a domain which poses few modelling
problems, and we focus on hyperonymy, which is
probably the least arguable semantic relation and has
been shown to be the easiest to extract. If the results are
poor under such favorable constraints, we can foresee
that they will be poorer for more complex (abstract)
domains and less clearly cut relations.
An ideal hierarchy probably does not exist for the entire
dictionary; however, a fair degree of consensus seems
possible for carefully chosen terms within a very
restricted domain. We have therefore selected a corpus
of one hundred kitchen utensil terms, each representing
a concrete, individual object--for example, cup, fork,
saucepan, decanter, etc. All of the terms are count
nouns. Mass nouns, which can cause problems, have
been excluded (for example, the mass noun cutlery is
not a hypernym of kn(e). Other idiosyncratic cases,
such as chopsticks (where it is not clear lithe utensil is
one object or a pair of objects) have also been
eliminated from the corpus. This makes it easy to apply
, simple tests for hyperonymy, which, for instance,
enable us to say that Y is a hypernym of X if &amp;quot;this is an
X&amp;quot; entails but is not entailed by &amp;quot;this is a Y&amp;quot; (Lyons,
1963).
Chodorow, Byrd, and Hcidorn (1985) proposed a
heuristic for extracting hypernyms which exploits the
fact that definitions for nouns typically give a hypernyrn
- 227 -
term as the head of the defining noun phrase. Consider
the following examples:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.72152">
dipper a ladle used for dipping... (CED]
ladle a long-handled spoon... ICED)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.945508428571429">
spoon a metal, wooden, or plastic utensil... [CEDI
In very general terms, the heuristic consists of
extracting the word which precedes the first
preposition, relative pronoun, or participle encountered
in the definition text. When this word is &amp;quot;empty&amp;quot; (e.g.
one, any, kind, class) the true hypernym is the head of
the noun phrase following the preposition of:
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.963049">
slice any of various utensils... ICED)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9919557">
Automatically extracted hierarchies arc necessarily
tangled (Amster, 1980) because many words arc
polysemous. For example, in the CED, the word pan
has the following senses (among others):
pan l.a a wide metal vessel... ICED)
pan2 1 the leaf of the betel tree... ICED)
The CED also gives pan as the hypemym for saucepan,
which taken together yields the hierarchy in figure 1.a.
The tangled hierarchy is problematic because, following
the path upwards from saucepan, we find that saucepan
can be a kind of leaf. This is clearly erroneous. A
hierarchy utilizing senses rather than words would not
be tangled, as shown in figure 1.b.
In our study, the hierarchy was disambiguated by hand.
Sense disambiguation in dictionary definitions is a
difficult problem, and we will not address it here; this
problem is the focus of much current research and is
considered in depth elsewhere (e.g., Byrd et al., 1987;
Byrd, 1989; Veronis and Ide, 1990; Klavans,
Chodorow, and Wacholder, 1990; Wilks et al., 1990).

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999744">
Hierarchies constructed with methods such as those
outlined in section 2 show, upon close inspection,
several serious problems. In this section, we describe
the most pervasive problems and give their frequency in
our five dictionaries. The problems fall into two general
types: those which arise because information in the
dictionary is incomplete, and those which are the result
of a lack of distinction among terms and the lack of a
one-to-one mapping between terms and concepts,
especially at the highest levels of the hierarchy.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.80437">
3.1. Incomplete information
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985131173333334">
The information in dictionaries is incomplete for two
main reasons. First, since a dictionary is typically the
product of several lexicographers&amp;apos; efforts and is
constructed, revised, and updated over many years,
there exist inconsistencies in the criteria by which the
hypernyms given in definition texts arc chosen. In
addition, space and readability restrictions, on the one
hand, and syntactic restrictions on phrasing, on the
other, may dictate that certain information is unspecified
in definition texts or left to be implied by other parts of
the definition.
11.1. Attachment too high : 21-34%
The most pervasive problem in automatically extracted
hierarchies is the attachment of terms too high in the
hierarchy. It occurs in 21-34% of the definitions in our
sample from the five dictionaries (figure 8). For
example, while pan and bottle are vessels in the CED,
cup and bowl are simply containers, the hypernym of
vessel. Obviously, &amp;quot;this is a cup&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;this is a bowl&amp;quot;
both entail (and are not entailed by) &amp;quot;this is a vessel&amp;quot;.
Further, other dictionaries give vessel as the hypcmym
for cup and bowl. Therefore, the attachment of cup and
bowl to the higher-level term container seems to be an
inconsistency within the CED.
The problem of attachment too high in the hierarchy
occurs relatively randomly within a given dictionary. In
dictionaries with a controlled definition vocabulary
(such as the LDOCE), the problem of attachment at
high levels of the hierarchy results also from a lack of
terms from which to choose. For example, ladle and
dipper are both attached to spoon in the LDOCE,
although &amp;quot;this is a dipper&amp;quot; entails and is not entailed by
&amp;quot;this is a ladle&amp;quot;. There is no way that dipper could be
defined as a ladle (as, for instance, in the CED), since
ladle is not in the defining vocabulary. As a result,
hierarchies extracted from the LDOCE are consistently
flat (figure 7).
3.1.2. Absent hypernyms : 0-3%
In some cases, strategies like that of Chodorow, Byrd
and Heidorn yield incorrect hypernyms, as in the
following definitions:
grill A grill is a part of a cooker... [COBUILD]
corkscrew a pointed spiral piece of metal... [W9)
dinner service a complete set of plates and dishes... [LDOCE,
not included in our corpus]
The words part, piece, set, are clearly not hypernyms
of the defined concepts: it is virtually meaningless to
say that grill is a kind of part, or that corkscrew is a
kind of piece. In these cases, the head of the noun
phrase serves to mark another relation: part-whole,
member-class, etc. It is easy to reject these and similar
words (member, series, etc.) as hypernyms, since they
form a closed list (Klavans, Chodorow, and
Wacholder, 1990). However, excluding these words
leaves us with no hypernym. We call these &amp;quot;absent
hypernyms&amp;quot;; they occur in 0-3% of the definitions in
our sample corpus (figure 8).
The absence of a hypernym in a given definition text
does not necessarily imply that no hypernym exists.
For example, &amp;quot;this is a corkscrew&amp;quot; clearly entails (and
is not entailed by) &amp;quot;this is a device&amp;quot; (the hypernym
given by the COBUILD and the CED). In many cases,
the lack of a hypernym seems to be the result of
concern over space and/or readability. We can imagine,
for example, that the definition for corkscrew could be
more fully specified as &amp;quot;a device consisting of a pointed
spiral piece of metal...&amp;quot; In such cases, lexicographers
rely on the reader&amp;apos;s ability to deduce that something
made of metal, with a handle, used for pulling corks,
can be called a device. However, for some terms, such
as cutlery or dinner service, it is not clear that a
hypernym exists. Note that we have voluntarily
excluded problematic terms of this kind from our
corpus, in ordet to restrict our evaluation to the best
case.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.406281">
3.1.3. Missing overlaps : 8-14%
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992161952380953">
Another problem results from the necessary choices that
lexicographers must make in an attempt to specify a
vessel leaf
- 228 -
single superordinatc, when concepts in the real world
overlap freely. For instance, a saucepan can be said to
be a pot as well as a pan . &amp;quot;This is a saucepan&amp;quot; entails
both &amp;quot;this is a pot&amp;quot; (the hypcmym given by the CED
and W9) as well as &amp;quot;this is a pan&amp;quot; (the hypernym given
by the LDOCE, OALD, and COBUILD). On the other
hand, &amp;quot;this is a pot&amp;quot; does not entail and is not entailed
by &amp;quot;this is a pan&amp;quot;, which is to say that pot and pan are
not synonyms, nor is one the hypernym of the other. In
terms of classes, pan and pot are distinct but
overlapping, and saucepan is a subset of their
intersection (figure 2.a). This is no longer a strict
hierarchy since it includes merging branches (figure
2.b). We will call it an &amp;quot;overlapping hierarchy&amp;quot;.
Although a tree representation of such a hierarchy is
impossible, it presents no problems on either logical or
computational grounds.

<bodyText confidence="0.9999479">
Assuming the above relations, it would be more
logically correct to phrase the definition of saucepan as
&amp;quot;a pan AND a pot...&amp;quot;. However, lexicographers never
use &amp;quot;and&amp;quot; in this way, but usually give only one of the
alternatives. For example, each of the five dictionaries
in our study chooses either pot or pan as the genus term
for saucepan. When this occurs, one of the hypemyms
is missing. This problem arises in our sample corpus
relatively frequently, 8-14% of the time depending on
the dictionary (figure 8).
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.984266">
3.2. Difficulties at higher levels
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9999632">
At the higher levels of the hierarchy, terms necessarily
become more general, and they often become less
clearly defined. For example, most people will agree on
whether some object falls into the category fork or
spoon, but there is much less agreement on what
objects are implements or utensils. In addition, at the
higher levels some concepts simply lack a term to
designate them exactly. As a result; there is confusion
at the higher levels of hierarchies implicit in dictionary
definitions.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.293208">
3.2.1. OR-conjoined heads : 7-10%
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995694827586207">
For 7-10% of the terms in our corpus, definitions give
a list of head nouns separated by the conjunction or, as
in the following:
utensil an implement, tool or container... !Mt
In this case, none of the three alternatives is a
hypemym of utensil. First, it is clearly not true that
&amp;quot;this is a utensil&amp;quot; entails &amp;quot;this is a container&amp;quot;. For the
other two, it is not clear whether or not &amp;quot;this is a
utensil&amp;quot; entails &amp;quot;this is a tool&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;this is an
implement&amp;quot;, and it is even less clear that the reverse
entailments do not apply. Regarding the three terms as
hypernyms of utensil would produce the hierarchy in
figure 3. However, by enumerating the paths upwards
from spatula (defined as a utensil), we see that spatula
is a kind of container, which is obviously incorrect.
This solution amounts to regarding the class of utensils
as the intersection of the classes of implements, tools,
and containers. Regarding the conjunction or as
denoting the union of these classes would be more
correct on logical grounds, since if X is included in A
or X is included in B, then X is included in A u B.
This relation cannot be fitted into a tree, but it can be
pictured as in figure 4. However, this does not help to
determine whether spatula is an implement, tool, or
container, or some subset of the three. In any case,
lexicographers do not use or with a consistent,
mathematical meaning. Or-conjoined heads appear not
to be usable in constructing hierarchical trees without
considerable manipulation and addition of information.

3.2.2. Circularity : 7-11%
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.939101076923077">
It is well known that circularity exists in dictionary
definitions, especially when concepts are high up in the
hierarchy. For instance, consider the definitions below:
tool an implement, such as a hammer... ICED]
implement a piece of equipment; tool or utensil. ICED]
utensil an implement, tool or container... ICED]
Circular definitions yield hierarchies containing loops
(figure 5.a). Unlike merging branches, loops have no
interpretation in terms of classes. A loop asserts both
that A is a sub-class of B and B is a sub-class of A,
which yields A ,= B. This is why Amster (1980)
suggests merging circularly-defined concepts and
regarding them as synonyms (figure 5.b).

<bodyText confidence="0.912242133333333">
However, in most cases this solution leads to erroneous
results; it is clear, for example, that many implements,
tools, and utensils (e.g., spatula) are not containers.
This problem is similar to the one cited above in section
3.2.1. If dictionary definitions are to be interpreted in
terms of set theoretical relations, a more complex
mathematical treatment is required. The definitions
above can be represented by the following relations:
tool C implement
Implement c (equipment t..; tool u utensil)
utensil c (implement u tool u container)
which, once solved, do not equate tool, implement,
and utensil, but instead define the overlapping classes
in figure 6. This representation is clearly more sound
on logical grounds. It still does not indicate exactly

where spatula should appear (since we have no
indication that it is not a container), but at least it shows
that there may be some utensils which are not
containers.
Although this representation is more intuitively accurate
than the representation in figure 5.b, ultimately it goes
too far in delineating the relations among terms. In
actual use, the distinctions among terms are much less
clear-cut than figure 6 implies. For instance, the figure
indicates that all tools that are containers are also
implements, but it is certainly not clear that humans
would agree to this or use the terms in a manner
consistent with this specification. Dictionaries

<bodyText confidence="0.9998159">
Altogether, the problems described in the sections
above yield a 55-70% error rate in automatically
extracted hierarchies. Given that we have attempted to
consider the most favorable case, it appears that any
single dictionary, taken in isolation, is a poor source of
automatically extracted semantic information. This is
made more evident in figure 7, which demonstrates the
marked differences in hierarchies extracted from the
CED and LDOCE for a small subset of our corpus. A

<bodyText confidence="0.999537">
We have concluded that hierarchies extracted using
strategies such as that of Chodorow, Byrd, and
Hcidorn are seriously flawed, and are therefore likely to
be unusable in NLP systems. However, in this section
we discuss various means to refine automatically
extracted hierarchies, most of which can be performed
automatically.

<bodyText confidence="0.987925697674419">
It is possible to use information provided in the
differentiae of definition texts to refine hierarchies; for
example, in the definition
vessel any object USED AS a container... ICED]
the automatically extracted hypernym is object.
However, some additional processing of the definition
text enables the extraction of container following the
phrase &amp;quot;used as&amp;quot;. It is also possible to use other
definitions. For example, the CED does not specify that
knife and spoon are implements, but this information is
provided in the definition of cutlery:
cutlery implements used for eating SUCII AS knives,
forks, and spoons. ICED]
The extraction of information from differentiae
demands some extra parsing, which may be difficult for
complex definitions. Also, further research is required
to determine which phrases function as markers for
which kind of information, and to determine how
consistent their use is. More importantly, such
information is sporadic, and its extraction may require
more effort than the results warrant. We therefore seek
more &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; methods to improve automatically
extracted hierarchies.
One of the most promising strategies for refining
extracted information is the use of information from
several dictionaries. Hierarchies derived from
individual dictionaries suffer from incompleteness, but
it is extremely unlikely that the same information is
consistently missing from all dictionaries. For instance,
the CED attaches cup to container, which is too high in
the hierarchy, while the W9 attaches it lower, to vessel.
It is therefore possible to use taxonomic information
from several dictionaries to fill in absent hypernyms,
missing links, and to rectify cases of too high
attachment.
To investigate this possibility, we merged the
information extracted from the five English dictionaries
in our database. The individual data for the five
dictionaries was organized in a table, as in figure 9.
Merging these hierarchies into a single hierarchy was
accomplished automatically by applying a simple
algorithm, which scans the table line-by-line, as
follows:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.776501428571429">
1) regard cells containing multiple heads conjoined
by or as null, since, as we saw in section 3.2.1, they
do not reliably provide a hypernym.
2) if all the cells agree (as for ladle), keep that term as
the hypernym. Otherwise:
a) if a term is a hypernym of another term in the
line, ignore it.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.993047027777778">
b) take the remaining cell or cells as the
hypernym(s).
This algorithm must be applied recursively, since, for
example, it may not yet be known when evaluating
basin that container is a hypernym of vessel, and vessel
is a hypernym of bowl, until those terms arc themselves
processed. Therefore, several passes through the table
are required. Note that if after applying the algorithm
several terms are left as hypernyms for a given word,
we effectively create an overlap in the hierarchy. For
example, saucepen is attached to both pot and pan, and
fork is attached to tool, implement, and instrument.
We evaluate the quality of the resulting combined
hierarchy using the same strategy applied in section 3.
It is interesting to note that in the merged hierarchy, all
the absent hypernym problems (including absence due
to or-heads) have been eliminated, since in every ease at
least one of the five dictionaries gives a valid
hypcmym. In addition, almost all of the attachments too
high in the hierarchy and missing overlaps have
disappeared, although a few cases remain (5% and 1%,
respectively). None of the dictionaries, for instance,
gives pot as the hypemym of teapot, although three of
the five dictionaries give pot as the hypernym of
coffeepot. A larger dictionary database would enable
the elimination of many of these remaining
imperfections (for example, New Penguin English
Dictionary, not included in our database, gives pot as a
hypernym of teapot).
Merging dictionaries on a large scale assumes that it is
possible to automatically map senses across them. For
our small sample, we mapped senses among
dictionaries by hand. We describe elsewhere a
promising method to automatically accomplish sense
mapping, using a spreading activation algorithm Ode
and Vdronis, 1990).

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.77283">
4.2. Covert categories
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995549507246378">
There remain a number of circularly-defined hypemyms
in the combined taxonomy, which demand additional
consideration on theoretical grounds. Circularly-defined
terms tend to appear when lexicographers lack terms to
designate certain concepts. The fact that &amp;quot;it is not
impossible for what is intuitively recognized as a
conceptual category to be without a label&amp;quot; has already
been noted (Cruse, 1986, p. 147). The lack of a
specific term for a recognizable concept tends to occur
more frequently at the higher levels of the hierarchy
(and at the very lowest and most specific levels as
well--e.g., there is no term to designate forks with two
prongs). This is probably because any language
includes the most terms at the generic level (Brown,
1958), that is, the level of everyday, ordinary terms for
objects and living things (dog, pencil, house, etc.).
Circularity, as well as the use of or-conjoined terms at
the high levels of the hierarchy, results largely from the
lexicographers&amp;apos; efforts to approximate the terms they
lack. For example, there is no clear term to denote that
category of objects which fall under any of the terms
utensil, tool, implement, instrument, although this
concept seems to exist. Clearly, these terms are not
strictly synonymous—there are, for example, utensils
that one would not call tools (e.g., a colander). If a
term, let us say X, for the concept existed, then the
definitions for utensil, tool, implement, and instrument
- 231 -
could simply read &amp;quot;an X that...&amp;quot;. Since this is not the
case, lexicographers define each term with a list
Including the others, which enables the delineation of a
concept which encompasses all of them.
One way to resolve difficulties at the higher levels of
extracted hierarchies is to introduce &amp;quot;covert categories&amp;quot;,
that is, concepts which do not correspond to any
particular word. We therefore do not merge circular
terms into a single concept, but instead create a
common &amp;quot;covert&amp;quot; hypernym for all of them. In this
way, tool, utensil, implement; and instrument each
appear in the hierarchy as kinds of INSTRUMENTAL-
OBJECT (covert categories names are capitalized).
We need a means to determine when and where covert
categories are necessary. Circularities in dictionary
definitions clearly indicate the presence of covert
categories. However, we obviously cannot use a single
dictionary to determine them, because the loops
contained in one dictionary rarely include all of the
terms that may be involved in the &amp;quot;constellation&amp;quot;
representing a given covert category. For instance, the
CED contains the loop tool-implement-utensil, while
the COBUILD contains a loop for tool-instrument; this
provides strong evidence that all four terms should be
involved in a constellation. Supporting information can
he derived by looking at the hyponyms for each of the
candidate terms in different dictionaries. The word
fork, for example, is defined as tool (COBUILD),
implement (CED, OALD, W9), and instrument
(LDOCE), while spoon is defined as object
(COB UILD), utensil (CED, OALD), tool (LDOCE)
and implement (W9),which adds further support to the
idea that tool, utensil, instrument, and implement
belong to the same constellation.
Even if it is relatively easy to automatically detect
circularities, the final determination of which covert
categories to create and the terms that are involved in
them must be done manually. However, this task is not
as daunting as it may first appear, since it involves only
the higher levels of the hierarchy, and likely involves a
relatively small number of covert categories.

By merging five dictionaries, all but 6% of the

The results of our study show that dictionaries can be a

<abstract confidence="0.993736830917876">In this paper we provide a quantitative evaluation of information automatically extracted from machine readable dictionaries. Our results show that for any one dictionary, 55-70% of the extracted information is garbled in some way. However, we show that these results can be dramatically reduced to about 6% by combining the information extracted from five dictionaries. It therefore appears that even if individual dictionaries are an unreliable source of semantic information, multiple dictionaries can play an important role in building large lexical-semantic databases. In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that the limited size of existing computational lexicons and the poverty of the semantic information they contain represents one of the primary bottlenecks in the development of realistic natural language processing (NLP) systems. The need for extensive lexical and databases is evident in the of a number of projects to construct massive generic lexicons for NLP (project GENELEX in Europe or EDR in Japan). The manual construction of large lexical-semantic databases demands enormous human resources, and there is a growing body of research into the possibility of automatically extracting at least a part of the required lexical and semantic information from everyday dictionaries. Everyday dictionaries are obviously not structured in a way that enables their immediate use in NLP systems, but several studies have shown that relatively simple procedures can be used to extract taxonomies and various other semantic relations (for example, Amster, 1980; Calzolari, 1984; Chodorow, Byrd, and Heidorn, 1985; Markowitz, Ahlswede, and 1986; Byrd al., Nakarnura and Nagao, 1988; Vdronis and Ide, 1990i Klavans, Chodorow, and 1990; Wilks al., However, it remains to be seen whether information automatically extracted from dictionaries is sufficiently complete and coherent to be actually usable in NLP systems. Although there is concern over the quality of automatically extracted lexical information, very few empirical studies have attempted to assess it systematically, and those that have done so have been restricted to consideration of the quality of grammatical Maserecuw, and Meijs, 1985). No evaluation of automatically extracted semantic information has been published. The authors would like to thank Lisa Lassck and Anne Gilman for their contribution to this work. In this paper, we report thc results of a quantitative evaluation of automatically extracted semantic data. Our results show that for any one dictionary, 55-70% of the extracted information is garbled in some way. These results at first call into doubt the validity of automatic extraction from dictionaries. However, in section 4 we show that these results can be dramatically reduced to about 6% by several means--most significantly, by combining the• information extracted from five dictionaries. It therefore appears that even if individual dictionaries are an unreliable source of semantic information, multiple dictionaries can play an important role in building large lexical-semantic databases. 2. METHODOLOGY Our strategy involves automatically extracting hypernyms from five English dictionaries for a limited corpus. To determine where problems exist, the resulting hierarchies for each dictionary are compared to &amp;quot;ideal&amp;quot; hierarchy constructed by hand. The compared were: the English (CED), Advanced Learner&amp;apos;s (OALD), Dictionary, the Long man&amp;apos;s Dictionary of Contemporary English the 9th Dictionary (W9). We begin with the most straightforward case in order to determine an upper bound for the results. We deal with words within a domain which poses few modelling problems, and we focus on hyperonymy, which is probably the least arguable semantic relation and has been shown to be the easiest to extract. If the results are poor under such favorable constraints, we can foresee that they will be poorer for more complex (abstract) domains and less clearly cut relations. An ideal hierarchy probably does not exist for the entire dictionary; however, a fair degree of consensus seems possible for carefully chosen terms within a very restricted domain. We have therefore selected a corpus of one hundred kitchen utensil terms, each representing concrete, individual object--for example, fork, decanter, etc. of the terms are count nouns. Mass nouns, which can cause problems, have excluded (for example, the mass noun a hypernym of idiosyncratic cases, as it is not clear lithe utensil is one object or a pair of objects) have also been eliminated from the corpus. This makes it easy to apply , simple tests for hyperonymy, which, for instance, enable us to say that Y is a hypernym of X if &amp;quot;this is an X&amp;quot; entails but is not entailed by &amp;quot;this is a Y&amp;quot; (Lyons, 1963). Chodorow, Byrd, and Hcidorn (1985) proposed a heuristic for extracting hypernyms which exploits the fact that definitions for nouns typically give a hypernyrn - 227 term as the head of the defining noun phrase. Consider the following examples: a for dipping... (CED] a long-handled a metal, wooden, or plastic In very general terms, the heuristic consists of extracting the word which precedes the first preposition, relative pronoun, or participle encountered in the definition text. When this word is &amp;quot;empty&amp;quot; (e.g. any, kind, class) true hypernym is the head of noun phrase following the preposition any of various Automatically extracted hierarchies arc necessarily 1980) because many words arc For example, in the word has the following senses (among others): wide metal 1 the the betel tree... ICED) gives the hypemym for which taken together yields the hierarchy in figure 1.a. The tangled hierarchy is problematic because, following path upwards from find that be a kind of is clearly erroneous. A hierarchy utilizing senses rather than words would not be tangled, as shown in figure 1.b. In our study, the hierarchy was disambiguated by hand. Sense disambiguation in dictionary definitions is a difficult problem, and we will not address it here; this problem is the focus of much current research and is in depth elsewhere (e.g., Byrd et Byrd, 1989; Veronis and Ide, 1990; Klavans, and Wacholder, 1990; Wilks al., vessel 1 leaf 1 I 1 I 2 pan Is pan 1 pan saucepan I saucepan hierarchy b) sense hierarchy Figure 1 : Sense-tangled&amp;quot; hierarchy Hierarchies constructed with methods such as those outlined in section 2 show, upon close inspection, several serious problems. In this section, we describe the most pervasive problems and give their frequency in our five dictionaries. The problems fall into two general types: those which arise because information in the dictionary is incomplete, and those which are the result of a lack of distinction among terms and the lack of a one-to-one mapping between terms and concepts, especially at the highest levels of the hierarchy. 3.1. Incomplete information The information in dictionaries is incomplete for two main reasons. First, since a dictionary is typically the product of several lexicographers&amp;apos; efforts and is constructed, revised, and updated over many years, there exist inconsistencies in the criteria by which the hypernyms given in definition texts arc chosen. In addition, space and readability restrictions, on the one hand, and syntactic restrictions on phrasing, on the other, may dictate that certain information is unspecified in definition texts or left to be implied by other parts of the definition. 11.1. Attachment too high : 21-34% The most pervasive problem in automatically extracted hierarchies is the attachment of terms too high in the hierarchy. It occurs in 21-34% of the definitions in our sample from the five dictionaries (figure 8). For while are vessels in the CED, simply hypernym of &amp;quot;this is a cup&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;this is a bowl&amp;quot; both entail (and are not entailed by) &amp;quot;this is a vessel&amp;quot;. other dictionaries give the hypcmym the attachment of the higher-level term to be an within the The problem of attachment too high in the hierarchy occurs relatively randomly within a given dictionary. In dictionaries with a controlled definition vocabulary as the problem of attachment at high levels of the hierarchy results also from a lack of from which to choose. For example, both attached to in the LDOCE, although &amp;quot;this is a dipper&amp;quot; entails and is not entailed by is a ladle&amp;quot;. There is no way that be as ladle (as, instance, in the is in the defining vocabulary. As a result, extracted from the consistently flat (figure 7). 3.1.2. Absent hypernyms : 0-3% In some cases, strategies like that of Chodorow, Byrd Heidorn yield as in the following definitions: A grill is a a cooker... [COBUILD] a pointed spiral metal... [W9) service a complete plates and dishes... [LDOCE, not included in our corpus] words piece, set, clearly not hypernyms defined concepts: it is virtually meaningless to that is kind of that is of In cases, the head of the noun phrase serves to mark another relation: part-whole, member-class, etc. It is easy to reject these and similar series, as hypernyms, since they form a closed list (Klavans, Chodorow, and Wacholder, 1990). However, excluding these words leaves us with no hypernym. We call these &amp;quot;absent hypernyms&amp;quot;; they occur in 0-3% of the definitions in our sample corpus (figure 8). The absence of a hypernym in a given definition text does not necessarily imply that no hypernym exists. For example, &amp;quot;this is a corkscrew&amp;quot; clearly entails (and is not entailed by) &amp;quot;this is a device&amp;quot; (the hypernym by the the many cases, the lack of a hypernym seems to be the result of concern over space and/or readability. We can imagine, example, that the definition for be fully specified as device of a pointed spiral piece of metal...&amp;quot; In such cases, lexicographers rely on the reader&amp;apos;s ability to deduce that something made of metal, with a handle, used for pulling corks, can be called a device. However, for some terms, such cutlery service, it not clear that a hypernym exists. Note that we have voluntarily excluded problematic terms of this kind from our corpus, in ordet to restrict our evaluation to the best case. 3.1.3. Missing overlaps : 8-14% Another problem results from the necessary choices that lexicographers must make in an attempt to specify a leaf - 228 single superordinatc, when concepts in the real world freely. For instance, saucepan be said to pot as as a . is a saucepan&amp;quot; entails &amp;quot;this is a pot&amp;quot; (the hypcmym given by the and W9) as well as &amp;quot;this is a pan&amp;quot; (the hypernym given the OALD, and COBUILD). the other hand, &amp;quot;this is a pot&amp;quot; does not entail and is not entailed &amp;quot;this is a pan&amp;quot;, which is to say that not synonyms, nor is one the hypernym of the other. In of classes, are but and is subset of their intersection (figure 2.a). This is no longer a strict hierarchy since it includes merging branches (figure 2.b). We will call it an &amp;quot;overlapping hierarchy&amp;quot;. Although a tree representation of such a hierarchy is impossible, it presents no problems on either logical or computational grounds. pot pan saucepans o) Figure 2. Overlapping hierarchy Assuming the above relations, it would be more correct to phrase the definition AND a pot...&amp;quot;. lexicographers never use &amp;quot;and&amp;quot; in this way, but usually give only one of the alternatives. For example, each of the five dictionaries our study chooses either the genus term this occurs, one of the hypemyms is missing. This problem arises in our sample corpus relatively frequently, 8-14% of the time depending on the dictionary (figure 8). 3.2. Difficulties at higher levels higher levels of the hierarchy, terms necessarily become more general, and they often become less clearly defined. For example, most people will agree on some object falls into the category there is much less agreement on what are addition, at the higher levels some concepts simply lack a term to designate them exactly. As a result; there is confusion at the higher levels of hierarchies implicit in dictionary definitions. 3.2.1. OR-conjoined heads : 7-10% For 7-10% of the terms in our corpus, definitions give list of head nouns separated by the conjunction in the following: utensil an tool In this case, none of the three alternatives is a of it is clearly not true that &amp;quot;this is a utensil&amp;quot; entails &amp;quot;this is a container&amp;quot;. For the other two, it is not clear whether or not &amp;quot;this is a utensil&amp;quot; entails &amp;quot;this is a tool&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;this is an implement&amp;quot;, and it is even less clear that the reverse entailments do not apply. Regarding the three terms as of produce the hierarchy in figure 3. However, by enumerating the paths upwards as a see that kind of is obviously incorrect. solution amounts to regarding the intersection of the classes of tools, the conjunction the union of these classes would be correct on logical grounds, since if X is included in A or X is included in B, then X is included in A u B. This relation cannot be fitted into a tree, but it can be pictured as in figure 4. However, this does not help to whether is an implement, tool, some subset of the three. In any case, do not or a consistent, mathematical meaning. Or-conjoined heads appear not to be usable in constructing hierarchical trees without considerable manipulation and addition of information. implement tool container utensil spatula : problematic hierarchy containers utensils tools Figure 4. OR as class union 3.2.2. Circularity : 7-11% It is well known that circularity exists in dictionary definitions, especially when concepts are high up in the hierarchy. For instance, consider the definitions below: an as a hammer... ICED] a piece of tool an tool Circular definitions yield hierarchies containing loops (figure 5.a). Unlike merging branches, loops have no interpretation in terms of classes. A loop asserts both A a sub-class of B is a sub-class of yields ,= B. is why Amster (1980) suggests merging circularly-defined concepts and regarding them as synonyms (figure 5.b). Figure 5. Taxonomy with loops However, in most cases this solution leads to erroneous it is clear, for example, that many not This problem is similar to the one cited above in section 3.2.1. If dictionary definitions are to be interpreted in terms of set theoretical relations, a more complex mathematical treatment is required. The definitions can represented by the following relations: implement Implement c (equipment t..; tool u utensil) utensil c (implement u tool u container) once solved, do not equate implement, instead define the overlapping classes in figure 6. This representation is clearly more sound on logical grounds. It still does not indicate exactly Figure 3 Implements container container I masil.s. Implement 1 1 a) - 229 appear (since we have no that it is not a at least it shows there may be some utensils which are containers. Although this representation is more intuitively accurate representation in figure 5.b, ultimately it goes too far in delineating the relations among terms. In actual use, the distinctions among terms are much less clear-cut than figure 6 implies. For instance, the figure indicates that all tools that are containers are also implements, but it is certainly not clear that humans would agree to this or use the terms in a manner consistent with this specification. Dictionaries Figure 6. Solving &amp;quot;loops&amp;quot; Figure 8 shows that 7-11% of the definitions use a hypcmym that is itself defined circularly. themselves do not agree, and when taken formally they yield very different diagrams for higher level concepts.

Quantitative evaluation pot coffee- Pot Figure 3.3. Summary Altogether, the problems described in the sections above yield a 55-70% error rate in automatically extracted hierarchies. Given that we have attempted to consider the most favorable case, it appears that any single dictionary, taken in isolation, is a poor source of automatically extracted semantic information. This is made more evident in figure 7, which demonstrates the marked differences in hierarchies extracted from the a small subset of our corpus. A summary of our results appears in figure 8. 4. REFINING We have concluded that hierarchies extracted using strategies such as that of Chodorow, Byrd, and Hcidorn are seriously flawed, and are therefore likely to be unusable in NLP systems. However, in this section we discuss various means to refine automatically extracted hierarchies, most of which can be performed automatically. - 230 - WORD COBUILD COLLINS LDOCE OA LD W9 Combined ladle spoon spoon spoon spoon spoon spoon basin container container container bowl vessel bowl ewer jug jug OR pitcher container pitcher pitcher OR jug pitcher saucepan pot Pan pot pot Pan pan AND grill (absent) device (absent) device utensil fork tool implement instrument implement implement tool, implement AND instrument Figure 9. Merging hierarchies 4.1. Merging dictionaries It is possible to use information provided in the definition texts to refine hierarchies; for example, in the definition object AS a ICED] extracted hypernym is However, some additional processing of the definition enables the extraction of the phrase &amp;quot;used as&amp;quot;. It is also possible to use other For example, the not specify that are implements, this information is in the definition of implements used for eating SUCII AS extraction of information from demands some extra parsing, which may be difficult for complex definitions. Also, further research is required to determine which phrases function as markers for which kind of information, and to determine how consistent their use is. More importantly, such information is sporadic, and its extraction may require more effort than the results warrant. We therefore seek more &amp;quot;brute force&amp;quot; methods to improve automatically extracted hierarchies. One of the most promising strategies for refining extracted information is the use of information from several dictionaries. Hierarchies derived from individual dictionaries suffer from incompleteness, but it is extremely unlikely that the same information is consistently missing from all dictionaries. For instance, is too high in hierarchy, while the W9 attaches it lower, to therefore possible to use taxonomic information from several dictionaries to fill in absent hypernyms, missing links, and to rectify cases of too high attachment. To investigate this possibility, we merged the information extracted from the five English dictionaries in our database. The individual data for the five dictionaries was organized in a table, as in figure 9. Merging these hierarchies into a single hierarchy was accomplished automatically by applying a simple algorithm, which scans the table line-by-line, as follows: 1) regard cells containing multiple heads conjoined null, since, as we saw in section 3.2.1, they do not reliably provide a hypernym. if all the cells agree (as for that term as the hypernym. Otherwise: a) if a term is a hypernym of another term in the it. b) take the remaining cell or cells as the hypernym(s). This algorithm must be applied recursively, since, for example, it may not yet be known when evaluating is hypernym of a hypernym of those terms arc themselves processed. Therefore, several passes through the table are required. Note that if after applying the algorithm several terms are left as hypernyms for a given word, we effectively create an overlap in the hierarchy. For is attached to attached to implement, We evaluate the quality of the resulting combined hierarchy using the same strategy applied in section 3. It is interesting to note that in the merged hierarchy, all the absent hypernym problems (including absence due to or-heads) have been eliminated, since in every ease at least one of the five dictionaries gives a valid hypcmym. In addition, almost all of the attachments too high in the hierarchy and missing overlaps have disappeared, although a few cases remain (5% and 1%, respectively). None of the dictionaries, for instance, the hypemym of three of five dictionaries give as hypernym of larger dictionary database would enable the elimination of many of these remaining (for example, Penguin English included in our database, gives as of Merging dictionaries on a large scale assumes that it is possible to automatically map senses across them. For our small sample, we mapped senses among dictionaries by hand. We describe elsewhere a promising method to automatically accomplish sense mapping, using a spreading activation algorithm Ode and Vdronis, 1990). 4.2. Covert categories There remain a number of circularly-defined hypemyms in the combined taxonomy, which demand additional consideration on theoretical grounds. Circularly-defined terms tend to appear when lexicographers lack terms to designate certain concepts. The fact that &amp;quot;it is not impossible for what is intuitively recognized as a conceptual category to be without a label&amp;quot; has already been noted (Cruse, 1986, p. 147). The lack of a specific term for a recognizable concept tends to occur frequently at the higher levels of (and at the very lowest and most specific levels as well--e.g., there is no term to designate forks with two prongs). This is probably because any language the most terms at the level 1958), that is, the level of everyday, ordinary terms for and living things pencil, house, Circularity, as well as the use of or-conjoined terms at high levels hierarchy, results largely from the lexicographers&amp;apos; efforts to approximate the terms they lack. For example, there is no clear term to denote that category of objects which fall under any of the terms tool, implement, instrument, this exist. Clearly, these terms are not synonymous—there are, for example, one would not call a a term, let us say X, for the concept existed, then the for tool, implement, and instrument - 231 could simply read &amp;quot;an X that...&amp;quot;. Since this is not the case, lexicographers define each term with a list Including the others, which enables the delineation of a concept which encompasses all of them. One way to resolve difficulties at the higher levels of extracted hierarchies is to introduce &amp;quot;covert categories&amp;quot;, that is, concepts which do not correspond to any particular word. We therefore do not merge circular terms into a single concept, but instead create a common &amp;quot;covert&amp;quot; hypernym for all of them. In this utensil, and appear in the hierarchy as kinds of INSTRUMENTAL- OBJECT (covert categories names are capitalized). We need a means to determine when and where covert categories are necessary. Circularities in dictionary definitions clearly indicate the presence of covert categories. However, we obviously cannot use a single dictionary to determine them, because the loops contained in one dictionary rarely include all of the terms that may be involved in the &amp;quot;constellation&amp;quot; representing a given covert category. For instance, the contains the loop a loop for provides strong evidence that all four terms should be involved in a constellation. Supporting information can he derived by looking at the hyponyms for each of the candidate terms in different dictionaries. The word example, is defined as (COBUILD), (CED, OALD, and spoon is defined as (COB UILD), utensil (CED, OALD), tool (LDOCE) adds further support to the that utensil, instrument, belong to the same constellation. Even if it is relatively easy to automatically detect circularities, the final determination of which covert categories to create and the terms that are involved in them must be done manually. However, this task is not as daunting as it may first appear, since it involves only the higher levels of the hierarchy, and likely involves a relatively small number of covert categories. 4.3. Summary By merging five dictionaries, all but 6% of the problems found in individual dictionaries were eliminated (figure 8). This result is made clear in figure 10, which includes the same small subset of the sample corpus as in the individual hierarchies given in figure 7. Although there remain a few imperfections, the combined hierarchy is much more accurate and complete, and therefore more useful, than the hierarchy derived from any one of the dictionaries alone. 5. CONCLUSION The results of our study show that dictionaries can be a reliable source of automatically extracted semantic information. Merging information from several dictionaries improved the quality of extracted information to an acceptable level. However, these results were obtained for a selected corpus representing a best case situation. It is likely that different results will be obtained for larger, less restricted cases. Our results suggest that this is an encouraging line of research to pursue for refining automatically extracted information.</abstract>
