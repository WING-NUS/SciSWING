Abstract
</sectionHeader>
      <bodyText confidence="0.9997309">
The SWAT TOOLS ontology verbaliser
generates a hierarchically organised hypertext
designed for easy comprehension and
navigation. The document structure, inspired
by encyclopedias and glossaries, is organised
at a number of levels. At the top level, a
heading is generated for every concept in
the ontology; at the next level, each entry
is subdivided into logically-based headings
like ‘Definition’ and ‘Examples’; at the
next, sentences are aggregated when they
have parts in common; at the lowest level,
phrases are hyperlinked to concept headings.
One consequence of this organisation is
that some statements are repeated because
they are relevant to more than one entry;
this means that the text is longer than one
in which statements are simply listed. This
trade-off between organisation and brevity is
investigated in a user study.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
      <bodyText confidence="0.9989182">
Since OWL (Web Ontology Language) became the
standard language for the semantic web in 2004,1
several research groups have developed systems,
known as ‘verbalisers’, for generating Controlled
English from OWL ontologies (Kaljurand and
Fuchs, 2007; Dolbear et al., 2007; Schwitter and
Tilbrook, 2004; Funk et al., 2007). The resulting
texts may contain linguistic errors, especially when
the lexicon is inferred from identifier names (as
in SWAT TOOLS) rather than handcrafted, but

they are still easier to understand than formal
languages (Kuhn, 2010). We describe here a
generic verbaliser2 (applicable to any OWL-DL
ontology with English identifiers/labels) which
delivers its output (e.g., figure 1) in the form of an
organised hypertext,3 akin to an online encyclopedia
or glossary, and investigate whether this extra
organisation makes the text easier to understand and
navigate.

Elsewhere (Stevens et al., 2010; Stevens et
al., 2011) we reported two evaluations with
bioinformatics staff in which the glossary-style
verbalisation was judged effective, for instance
in detecting errors in the knowledge; however,
these studies were not designed to test the
value of organisation, through comparison with
an unorganised list of statements. It might seem
obvious that organisation will help: indeed, teachers
of reading comprehension are required to ensure that

their students are aware of the use of textual features
such as headings and subheadings in locating
information (Steeds, 2001); and it comes as no
surprise that reading strategies differ between a text
structured as an encyclopedia and one organised as,
say, a poem (Hanauer, 1998). However, organisation
actually has one potential disadvantage, in that
statements may be relevant in more than one context,
and must thus be repeated. We describe here a
study which checks this point by pitting organisation
against brevity for a task requiring accurate retrieval
of information from a text.

2 Verbalising statements
</sectionHeader>
      <bodyText confidence="0.995766">
The input to a verbaliser is a set of OWL statements
describing individuals, classes or properties; the
simplest output therefore consists of a set of
sentences, one per statement, as illustrated in figure
2, where the sentence ‘A cribellar spigot is part of
a cribellum’ has been generated from the following
statement:4
</bodyText>
      <equation confidence="0.68164725">
subClassOf(class(#SPD_0000276),
objectSomeValuesFrom(
objectProperty(#part_of),
class(#SPD_0000115)))
</equation>
      <bodyText confidence="0.999838">
The basic verbalisation method in SWAT TOOLS
has been described in detail elsewhere (Stevens
et al., 2011). Briefly, the OWL/XML input is
transcoded to Prolog,5 using the format illustrated in
the example just given; then a lexicon for realising
atomic terms (individuals, classes or properties) is
inferred from their identifier names or labels; finally,
a sentence is generated from each statement using
a Definite Clause Grammar (Clocksin and Mellish,
1987) covering almost all of OWL-DL, using
wording influenced by earlier work on controlled
languages (Schwitter et al., 2008; Kaljurand and
Fuchs, 2007; Dolbear et al., 2007).
Sentences are ordered according to the alphabetical
order of their underlying OWL statements: i.e.,
sentences generated from ClassAssertion
statements will come before those generated from
SubClassOf statements.

3 Document structuring
</sectionHeader>
      <bodyText confidence="0.999940153846154">
The highest levels of organisation, illustrated
in figure 1, are headings and subheadings.
Subheadings are inspired mainly by Berzlanovich et
al.’s (2008) ‘information oriented’ discourse labels
(name, definition, description, etc.) from their
analysis of the discourse structure of encyclopedia
articles; and also by Aristotle’s genus-differentia
descriptions.6
Lower levels of organisation were also influenced
by Berzlanovich et al. (2008), whose investigation
of lower-level lexical cohesion in encylopedia
entries highlighted the high incidence of hypernymic
lexical cohesion.
</bodyText>
      <subsectionHeader confidence="0.995244">
3.1 Headings
</subsectionHeader>
      <bodyText confidence="0.9979119375">
The top level of organisation is an alphabetical series
of headings corresponding to atomic terms in the
ontology (i.e., individuals, classes, or object/data
properties), taken directly from the lexicon that the
system infers from the ontology’s identifier names or
labels. Where singular and plural forms have been
inferred, the singular is used, as illustrated by ‘SETA
CEPHALOTHORAX (class)’ in figure 1.
An OWL statement is selected for inclusion
under a heading if the class, property or individual
that the heading refers to occurs as a top-level
argument in the statement.7 Inevitably, sentences
that apply to more than one group are duplicated,
e.g., ‘a seta appendage cephalothorax is a seta’
is added to entries for both SETA APPENDAGE
CEPHALOTHORAX and SETA.
</bodyText>
      <subsectionHeader confidence="0.998936">
3.2 Subheadings
</subsectionHeader>
      <bodyText confidence="0.950369285714286">
The second level of organisation is a set of
subheadings. Within each entry, statements are
organised into sub-groups according to their logical
type. Subheadings are always generated in a
fixed order (Definition, Taxonomy, Description,
Distinctions, Examples) similar to that found
in encyclopedia entries (Berzlanovich et al.,
2008). For classes, EquivalentClasses
statements in which the atomic class is the first
6en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genusdifferentia definition
7Theoretically, this could mean that some statements are
omitted altogether because their top-level arguments are non-
atomic, but in practice such statements are almost never found
(Power and Third, 2010).

      <bodyText confidence="0.999984142857143">
argument occur under the definition subheading,
the taxonomy is the superclass (from an OWL
SubClassOf statement), descriptive statements
correspond to the OWL functor SubClassOf,
distinctions to DisjointClasses, and examples
to the individuals belonging to the class. For
individuals the class is given first (from an
OWL ClassAssertion statement), followed
by descriptions typically corresponding to
ObjectPropertyAssertion. For properties, the
descriptive statements specify the domain and range,
and features such as functionality and transitivity,
and examples are provided by statements about
individuals or classes in which the property is used.
</bodyText>
      <subsectionHeader confidence="0.999246">
3.3 Aggregating and truncating
</subsectionHeader>
      <bodyText confidence="0.999973866666667">
A third level of organisation occurs when statements
with identical structures and one identical argument
are aggregated; see Williams and Power (2010) for
more details. For some ontologies, this process can
lead to very long lists of subclasses or individuals,
so under the ‘Examples’ subheading where these
occur we truncate them to a predefined maximum
length and add the phrase ‘and so on (N items in
total)’. Figure 1 shows an example of aggregation
and truncation in the sentence ‘The following
are seta appendage cephalothorax: male palpal
femoral thorns, female palp femoral thorns and spd
0000203s, and so on (5 items in total)’. An obvious
refinement would be to add a facility to view the
entire list, if desired.
</bodyText>
      <subsectionHeader confidence="0.990227">
3.4 Hypertext links
</subsectionHeader>
      <bodyText confidence="0.999985">
The final and lowest level of organisation occurs
when hyperlinks are introduced for each phrase
corresponding to a class, individual or property;
these link to the headings of their entries.

3.5 Related systems
</sectionHeader>
      <bodyText confidence="0.99996425">
To our knowledge, SWAT TOOLS takes document
structuring further than other domain-independent
ontology verbalisers. We are aware of only one other
domain-independent system that attempts document
structuring, ACE (Kaljurand and Fuchs, 2007). ACE
lists statements under class, individual and property
headings; and it inserts hyperlinks; but it has no
intermediate levels of organisation.
Regarding domain-dependent systems, most of
them aggregate statements and generate referring
expressions (Bontcheva and Wilks, 2004; Dongilli,
2008; Galanis and Androutsopoulos, 2007;
Hielkema, 2009; Liang et al., 2011). Only one
attempts further discourse structuring: Laing et al.’s
system for verbalising medical ontologies organises
text according to rhetorical structure.

4 Evaluation
</sectionHeader>
      <bodyText confidence="0.999967083333333">
The evaluation study reported here focusses on
the following question: Does the organisation just
described help people to understand and navigate
a text in spite of its longer length? This is
addressed through a navigation task in which people
were asked to locate information in either an
organised text or an unorganised one and then give
a judgement on how difficult the information was to
find. The study design is between-subjects in two
independent groups. Participants were 57 members
of the ACL special interest groups SIGGEN8 and
SIGdial9.

4.1 Materials and method
</subsectionHeader>
      <bodyText confidence="0.999975894736842">
The texts were generated from an ontology about
spider anatomy.3 One group saw the encyclopedia-
styled version illustrated in figure 1, henceforth the
‘organised text’; the other saw the same information
as a list of sentences10 as shown in figure 2
(‘unorganised text’). At 7746 words (25 A4-sized
pages), the organised text is much longer than
the unorganised one (4803 words, 9-pages) mainly
because of duplicated information and headings (as
explained in section 3). To render the unorganised
text’s appearance as similar as possible to the
organised one, spaces were introduced every fourth
line with blocks of text placed on a taupe-coloured
background identical to that of the entries in the
organised text.
The same five navigation and information
location tasks (table 1) were used for both groups.
The survey was administered via SurveyMonkey11
in which each navigation question was followed

by a judgement ‘How difficult was it to find the
information?’ on a 5-point scale (‘Very Easy’ to

Regarding search for information to answer
the questions, both texts were viewed on-line
and of course could be navigated with the usual
‘Find’ menu items, CTRL-F key sequence, and
so on. To determine whether textual features
such as headings, subheadings and hyperlinks had
been used, subjects with the organised text were
asked whether the following features had helped
them to search for information: (i) heading, (ii)
typology subheading, (iii) description subheading,
(iv) examples subheading, (v) alphabetical ordering
of entries,(vi) hyperlinks within entries, and (vii)
totals for number of items in lists (section 3.3).
Subjects given the unorganised text answered
instead seven questions about techniques used for
navigation, e.g., ‘Did you use scrolling?’.

in locating information. However, difficulty

(see table 3), with the group using the organised
text judging the tasks much easier. This preference
was confirmed by a non-parametric independent

(p &lt; 0.0001). Results for questions about usage
of specific organisational features (answered only by

</sectionHeader>
      <bodyText confidence="0.99992075">
In our earlier user studies (Stevens et al., 2010;
Stevens et al., 2011), experts in bioinformatics
assessed technical descriptions corresponding
to glossary entries, with statements linked by
aggregation but not grouped by logical subheadings.
The consensus was that these were understandable,
and useful to developers as a means of checking
accuracy. However, various criticisms were made,

the main theme being that natural English should be
priveleged over fidelity to OWL semantics.
The SWAT TOOLS system evaluated here
incorporates some stylistic changes proposed in
the earlier study, and retains the aggregation
feature which combines several statements into a
single sentence (thus potentially reducing fidelity
to the underlying OWL); it also adds grouping by
subheadings. None of this organisation is directly
encoded in an OWL ontology: it represents rather a
further move towards making the verbalisation more
natural and humanlike.
From our study comparing organised and
unorganised texts, two main points emerge: first, we
find no evidence that people viewing the organised
text perform a navigation task more accurately;
second, people viewing the organised texts found
the task easier. One explanation for these findings
would be that people do whatever is necessary to
achieve a desired level of performance, so that when
provided with superior tools they achieve roughly
the same result but with less effort.12
The drop in performance by the unorganised
text group on question 1 might have been due
to unfamiliarity with a sentence-list type of text
(all participants answered question 1 first since
questions were always presented in the same order).
Improvements on later questions could have been
the result of a learning effect with this group. The
near-perfect performance of the organised text group
on the first questions demonstrates the benefit of
viewing a familiar genre. A drop in performance
by the unorganised text group on question 5,
‘How many kinds of seta appendage cephalothorax

a point we intend to check in future work.
are there in total?’ was expected since it is a
harder question that requires a search of the entire
unorganised text whilst simultaneously counting
instances. It is not clear why four people in
the organised text group failed to get the correct
answer to question 5 since it merely requred them
to understand the text ‘5 items in total’ under
‘Examples’ (see figure 1).
Regarding the analysis of different organisational
features, the overall response was that all these
features were considered useful by a majority
of users, although none of them stood out as
particularly important.

6 Conclusion
</sectionHeader>
      <bodyText confidence="0.999989833333333">
We assume that most users prefer an ontology
verbalisation that is worded and organised like a
naturally occurring text of the appropriate genre —
i.e., an encyclopedia or technical glossary. One
possible objection is that such a text provides a
loose rendering of OWL semantics, introducing
organisational principles that are not present in
the original code; however, as evidenced by the
earlier studies we have cited, this attitude is not
taken even by OWL specialists. A second possible
objection is that the organised text is necessarily
longer than a bare list of sentences; this point is
tested in the study reported here, which suggests
that organisation makes the texts easier to use, with
no loss of performance. In future work we intend
to look more closely at how the texts are used in
retrieval tasks, and to obtain accurate measures of
time differences.

      <abstract confidence="0.998710857142857">SWAT verbaliser generates a hierarchically organised hypertext designed for easy comprehension and navigation. The document structure, inspired by encyclopedias and glossaries, is organised at a number of levels. At the top level, a heading is generated for every concept in the ontology; at the next level, each entry is subdivided into logically-based headings like ‘Definition’ and ‘Examples’; at the next, sentences are aggregated when they have parts in common; at the lowest level, phrases are hyperlinked to concept headings. One consequence of this organisation is some statements are they are relevant to more than one entry; this means that the text is longer than one in which statements are simply listed. This trade-off between organisation and brevity is investigated in a user study.</abstract>

Subheadings are inspired mainly by Berzlanovich et al.’s (2008) ‘information oriented’ discourse labels (name, definition, description, etc.) from their analysis of the discourse structure of encyclopedia articles; and also by Aristotle’s genus-differentia descriptions.6 Lower levels of organisation were also influenced by Berzlanovich et al. (2008), whose investigation of lower-level lexical cohesion in encylopedia entries highlighted the high incidence of hypernymic lexical cohesion. 3.1 Headings The top level of organisation is an alphabetical series of headings corresponding to atomic terms in the ontology (i.e., individuals, classes, or object/data properties), taken directly from the lexicon that the system infers from the ontology’s identifier names or labels. Where singular and plural forms have been inferred, the singular is used, as illustrated by ‘SETA CEPHALOTHORAX (class)’ in figure 1. An OWL statement is selected for inclus</context>

Within each entry, statements are organised into sub-groups according to their logical type. Subheadings are always generated in a fixed order (Definition, Taxonomy, Description, Distinctions, Examples) similar to that found in encyclopedia entries (Berzlanovich et al., 2008). For classes, EquivalentClasses statements in which the atomic class is the first 6en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genusdifferentia definition 7Theoretically, this could mean that some statements are omitted altogether because their top-level arguments are nonatomic, but in practice such statements are almost never found (Power and Third, 2010). 159 argument occur under the definition subheading, the taxonomy is the superclass (from an OWL SubClassOf statement), descriptive statements correspond to the OWL functor SubClassOf, distinctions to DisjointClasses, and examples to the individuals belonging to</context>

Briefly, the OWL/XML input is transcoded to Prolog,5 using the format illustrated in the example just given; then a lexicon for realising atomic terms (individuals, classes or properties) is inferred from their identifier names or labels; finally, a sentence is generated from each statement using a Definite Clause Grammar (Clocksin and Mellish, 1987) covering almost all of OWL-DL, using wording influenced by earlier work on controlled languages (Schwitter et al., 2008; Kaljurand and Fuchs, 2007; Dolbear et al., 2007). Sentences are ordered according to the alphabetical order of their underlying OWL statements: i.e., sentences generated from ClassAssertion statements will come before those generated from SubClassOf statements. 4The ‘non-semantic’ identifiers #SPD 0000276 and #SPD 0000276 are annotated with English labels elsewhere in the ontology. 5The verbaliser is implemented in SWI Prolog 3 Document structuring The highest levels of organisation, illustrated in figure 1, are headings and subheadings.

An obvious refinement would be to add a facility to view the entire list, if desired. 3.4 Hypertext links The final and lowest level of organisation occurs when hyperlinks are introduced for each phrase corresponding to a class, individual or property; these link to the headings of their entries. 3.5 Related systems To our knowledge, SWAT TOOLS takes document structuring further than other domain-independent ontology verbalisers. We are aware of only one other domain-independent system that attempts document structuring, ACE (Kaljurand and Fuchs, 2007). ACE lists statements under class, individual and property headings; and it inserts hyperlinks; but it has no intermediate levels of organisation. Regarding domain-dependent systems, most of them aggregate statements and generate referring expressions (Bontcheva and Wilks, 2004; Dongilli, 2008; Galanis and Androutsopoulos, 2007; Hielkema, 2009; Liang et al., 2011).

For properties, the descriptive statements specify the domain and range, and features such as functionality and transitivity, and examples are provided by statements about individuals or classes in which the property is used. 3.3 Aggregating and truncating A third level of organisation occurs when statements with identical structures and one identical argument are aggregated; see Williams and Power (2010) for more details. For some ontologies, this process can lead to very long lists of subclasses or individuals, so under the ‘Examples’ subheading where these occur we truncate them to a predefined maximum length and add the phrase ‘and so on (N items in total)’.
