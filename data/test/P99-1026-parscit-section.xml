Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9995966875">
This paper proposes a method for incrementally un-
derstanding user utterances whose semantic bound-
aries are not known and responding in real time
even before boundaries are determined. It is an
integrated parsing and discourse processing method
that updates the partial result of understanding word
by word, enabling responses based on the partial
result. This method incrementally finds plausible
sequences of utterances that play crucial roles in
the task execution of dialogues, and utilizes beam
search to deal with the ambiguity of boundaries as
well as syntactic and semantic ambiguities. The re-
sults of a preliminary experiment demonstrate that
this method understands user utterances better than
an understanding method that assumes pauses to be
semantic boundaries.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999763">
Building a real-time, interactive spoken dialogue
system has long been a dream of researchers, and the
recent progress in hardware technology and speech
and language processing technologies is making this
dream a reality. It is still hard, however, for com-
puters to understand unrestricted human utterances
and respond appropriately to them. Considering
the current level of speech recognition technology,
system-initiative dialogue systems, which prohibit
users from speaking unrestrictedly, are preferred
(Walker et al., 1998). Nevertheless, we are still
pursuing techniques for understanding unrestricted
user utterances because, if the accuracy of under-
standing can be improved, systems that allow users
to speak freely could be developed and these would
be more useful than systems that do not.
Most previous spoken dialogue systems (e.g. sys-
tems by Allen et al. (1996), Zue et al. (1994) and
Peckham (1993)) assume that the user makes one
utterance unit in each speech interval, unless the
push-to-talk method is used. Here, by utterance
unit we mean a phrase from which a speech act
representation is derived, and it corresponds to a
sentence in written language. We also use speech
act in this paper to mean a command that up-
dates the hearer&apos;s belief state about the speaker&apos;s
intention and the context of the dialogue. In this
paper, a system using this assumption is called an
interval-based system.
The above assumption no longer holds when no
restrictions are placed on the way the user speaks.
This is because utterance boundaries (i.e., semantic
boundaries) do not always correspond to pauses
and techniques based on other acoustic information
are not perfect. Utterance boundaries thus cannot
be identified prior to parsing, and so the timing
of determining parsing results to update the belief
state is unclear. On the other hand, responding to
a user utterance in real time requires understanding
it and updating the belief state in real time; thus,
it is impossible to wait for subsequent inputs to
determine boundaries.
Abandoning full parsing and adopting keyword-
based or fragment-based understanding could pre-
vent this problem. This would, however, sacri-
fice the accuracy of understanding because phrases
across the pauses could not be syntactically ana-
lyzed. There is, therefore, a need for a method
based on full parsing that enables real-time un-
derstanding of user utterances without boundary
information.

enables incremental understanding of user utter-
ances word by word by finding plausible sequences
of utterances that play crucial roles in the task ex-
ecution of dialogues. The method utilizes beam
search to deal with the ambiguity of boundaries as
well as syntactic and semantic ambiguities. Since it
outputs the partial result of understanding that is the
most plausible whenever a word hypothesis is in-
putted, the response generation module can produce
responses at any appropriate time. A comparison
of an experimental spoken dialogue system using
ISSS with an interval-based system shows that the
method is effective.

2 Problem
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999691139534884">
A dilemma is addressed in this paper. First, it is diffi-
cult to identify utterance boundaries in spontaneous
speech in real time using only pauses. Observation
of human-human dialogues reveals that humans of-
ten put pauses in utterances and sometimes do not
put pauses at utterance boundaries. The following
human utterance shows where pauses might appear
in an utterance.
I&apos;d like to make a reservation for a con-
ference room (pause) for, uh (pause) this
afternoon (pause) at about (pause) say
(pause) 2 or 3 o&apos;clock (pause) for (pause)
15 people
As far as Japanese is concerned, several studies
have pointed out that speech intervals in dialogues
are not always well-formed substrings (Seligman et
al., 1997; Takezawa and Morimoto, 1997).
On the other hand, since parsing results can-
not be obtained unless the end of the utterance is
identified, making real-time responses is impossi-
ble without boundary information. For example,
consider the utterance &amp;quot;I&apos;d like to book Meeting
Room 1 on Wednesday&amp;quot;. It is expected that the
system should infer the user wants to reserve the
room on &apos;Wednesday this week&apos; if this utterance was
made on Monday. In real conversations, however,
there is no guarantee that &apos;Wednesday&apos; is the final
word of the utterance. It might be followed by the
phrase &apos;next week&apos;, in which case the system made
a mistake in inferring the user&apos;s intention and must
backtrack and re-understand. Thus, it is not possible
to determine the interpretation unless the utterance
boundary is identified. This problem is more serious
in head-final languages such as Japanese because
function words that represent negation come after
content words. Since there is no explicit clue in-
dicating an utterance boundary in unrestricted user
utterances, the system cannot make an interpretation
and thus cannot respond appropriately. Waiting for
a long pause enables an interpretation, but prevents
response in real time. We therefore need a way
to reconcile real-time understanding and analysis
without boundary clues.

3 Previous Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999860457142857">
Several techniques have been proposed to segment
user utterances prior to parsing. They use into-
nation (Wang and Hirschberg, 1992; Traum and
Heeman, 1997; Heeman and Allen, 1997) and prob-
abilistic language models (Stolcke et al., 1998;
Ramaswamy and Kleindienst, 1998; Cettolo and
Falavigna, 1998). Since these methods are not
perfect, the resulting segments do not always cor-
respond to utterances and might not be parsable
because of speech recognition errors. In addition,
since the algorithms of the probabilistic methods are
not designed to work in an incremental way, they
cannot be used in real-time analysis in a straightfor-
ward way.
Some methods use keyword detection (Rose,
1995; Hatazaki et al., 1994; Seto et al., 1994) and
key-phrase detection (Aust et al., 1995; Kawahara
et al., 1996) to understand speech mainly because
the speech recognition score is not high enough.
The lack of the full use of syntax in these ap-
proaches, however, means user utterances might be
misunderstood even if the speech recognition gave
the correct answer. Zechner and Waibel (1998) and
Worm (1998) proposed understanding utterances by
combining partial parses. Their methods, however,
cannot syntactically analyze phrases across pauses
since they use speech intervals as input units. Al-
though Lavie et al. (1997) proposed a segmentation
method that combines segmentation prior to parsing
and segmentation during parsing, but it suffers from
the same problem.
In the parser proposed by Core and Schubert
(1997), utterances interrupted by the other dialogue
participant are analyzed based on meta-rules. It is
unclear, however, how this parser can be incorpo-

rated into a real-time dialogue system; it seems that
it cannot output analysis results without boundary
clues.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.973801">
4.1 Overview
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999987083333333">
The above problem can be solved by incremen-
tal understanding, which means obtaining the most
plausible interpretation of user utterances every time
a word hypothesis is inputted from the speech recog-
nizer. For incremental understanding, we propose
incremental significant-utterance-sequence search
(ISSS), which is an integrated parsing and dis-
course processing method. ISSS holds multiple
possible belief states and updates those belief states
when a word hypothesis is inputted. The response
generation module produces responses based on the
most likely belief state. The timing of responses
is determined according to the content of the belief
states and acoustic clues such as pauses.
In this paper, to simplify the discussion, we as-
sume the speech recognizer incrementally outputs
elements of the recognized word sequence. Need-
less to say, this is impossible because the most likely
word sequence cannot be found in the midst of the
recognition; only networks of word hypotheses can
be outputted. Our method for incremental process-
ing, however, can be easily generalized to deal with
incremental network input, and our experimental
system utilizes the generalized method.

4.2 Significant-Utterance Sequence
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999824659090909">
A significant utterance (SU) in the user&apos;s speech is
a phrase that plays a crucial role in performing the
task in the dialogue. An SU may be a full sentence
or a subsentential phrase such as a noun phrase
or a verb phrase. Each SU has a speech act that
can be considered a command to update the belief
state. SU is defined as a syntactic category by the
grammar for linguistic processing, which includes
semantic inference rules.
Any phrases that can change the belief state
should be defined as SUs. Two kinds of SUs can
be considered; domain-related ones that express
the user&apos;s intention about the task of the dialogue
and dialogue-related ones that express the user&apos;s
attitude with respect to the progress of the dia-
logue such as confirmation and denial. Considering
a meeting room reservation system, examples of
domain-related SUs are &amp;quot;I need to book Room 2 on
Wednesday&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;I need to book Room 2&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Room
2&amp;quot; and dialogue-related ones are &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;, and
&amp;quot;Okay&amp;quot;.
User utterances are understood by finding a se-
quence of SUs and updating the belief state based
on the sequence. The utterances in the sequence
do not overlap. In addition, they do not have to
be adjacent to each other, which leads to robustness
against speech recognition errors as in fragment-
based understanding (Zechner and Waibel, 1998;
Worm, 1998).
The belief state can be computed at any point
in time if a significant-utterance sequence for user
utterances up to that point in time is given. The
belief state holds not only the user&apos;s intention but
also the history of system utterances, so that all
discourse information is stored in it.
Consider, for example, the following user speech
in a meeting room reservation dialogue.
I need to, uh, book Room 2, and it&apos;s on
Wednesday.
The most likely significant-utterance sequence con-
sists of &amp;quot;I need to, uh, book Room 2&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;it&apos;s on
Wednesday&amp;quot;. From the speech act representation of
these utterances, the system can infer the user wants
to book Room 2 on Wednesday.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999825">
4.3 Finding Significant-Utterance Sequences
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9998676875">
SUs are identified in the process of understanding.
Unlike ordinary parsers, the understanding mod-
ule does not try to determine whether the whole
input forms an SU or not, but instead determines
where SUs are. Although this can be considered a
kind of partial parsing technique (McDonald, 1992;
Lavie, 1996; Abney, 1996), the SUs obtained by
ISSS are not always subsentential phrases; they are
sometimes full sentences.
For one discourse, multiple significant-utterance
sequences can be considered. &amp;quot;Wednesday next
week&amp;quot; above illustrates this well. Let us assume
that the parser finds two SUs, &amp;quot;Wednesday&amp;quot; and
&amp;quot;Wednesday next week&amp;quot;. Then three significant-
utterance sequences are possible: one consisting of
&amp;quot;Wednesday&amp;quot;, one consisting of &amp;quot;Wednesday next
</bodyText>

week&amp;quot;, and one consisting of no SUs. The second
sequence is obviously the most likely at this point,
but it is not possible to choose only one sequence
and discard the others in the midst of a dialogue.
We therefore adopt beam search. Priorities are
assigned to the possible sequences, and those with
low priorities are neglected during the search.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.890727">
4.4 ISSS Algorithm
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99961375">
The ISSS algorithm is based on shift-reduce parsing.
The basic data structure is context, which represents
search information and is a triplet of the following
data.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.89525675">
stack: A push-down stack used in a shift-
reduce parser.
belief state: A set of the system&apos;s beliefs
about the user&apos;s intention with re-
spect to the task of the dialogue and
dialogue history.
priority: A number assigned to the con-
text.
Accordingly, the algorithm is as follows.
(I) Create a context in which the stack and the
belief state are empty and the priority is zero.
(II) For each input word, perform the following
process.
1. Obtain the lexical feature structure for
the word and push it to the stacks of all
existing contexts.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.762329533333333">
2. For each context, apply rules as in a
shift-reduce parser. When a shift-reduce
conflict or a reduce-reduce conflict occur,
the context is duplicated and different
operations are performed on them. When
a reduce operation is performed, increase
the priority of the context by the priority
assigned to the rule used for the reduce
operation.
3. For each context, if the top of the stack
is an SU, empty the stack and update the
belief state according to the content of the
SU. Increase the priority by the square of
the length (i.e., the number of words) of
this SU.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.995673">
(I) SU [day: ?x] NP [sort: day, sem: ?x]

<figureCaption confidence="0.884736">

</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.962792571428571">
4. Discard contexts with low priority so that
the number of remaining contexts will be
the beam width or less.
Since this algorithm is based on beam search, it
works in real time if Step (II) is completed quickly
enough, which is the case in our experimental sys-
tem.
The priorities for contexts are determined using
a general heuristics based on the length of SUs and
the kind of rules used. Contexts with longer SUs are
preferred. The reason we do not use the length of an
SU, but its square instead, is that the system should
avoid regarding an SU as consisting of several short
SUs. Although this heuristics seems rather simple,
we have found it works well in our experimental
systems.
Although some additional techniques, such as
discarding redundant contexts and multiplying a
weight w (w &gt; 1) to the priority of each context after
the Step 4, are effective, details are not discussed
here for lack of space.

4.5 Response Generation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999415916666667">
The contexts created by the utterance understanding
module can also be accessed by the response gener-
ation module so that it can produce responses based
on the belief state in the context with the highest
priority at a point in time. We do not discuss the tim-
ing of the responses here, but, generally speaking,
a reasonable strategy is to respond when the user
pauses. In Japanese dialogue systems, producing a
backchannel is effective when the user&apos;s intention
is not clear at that point in time, but determining the
content of responses in a real-time spoken dialogue
system is also beyond the scope of this paper.

&apos;next week&apos; is one word. The speech recognizer
incrementally sends to the understanding module
the word hypotheses &apos;Wednesday&apos; and &apos;next week&apos;.
The rules used in this example are shown in Figure 1.
They are unification-based rules. Not all features
and semantic constraints are shown. In this exam-
ple, nouns and noun phrases are not distinguished.
The ISSS execution is shown in Figure 2.
When &apos;Wednesday&apos; is inputted, its lexical feature
structure is created and pushed to the stack. Since
Rule (I) can be applied to this stack, (2b) in Figure 2
is created. The top of the stack in (2b) is an SU, thus
(2c) is created, whose belief state contains the user&apos;s
intention of meeting room reservation on Wednes-
day this week. We assume that &apos;Wednesday&apos; means
Wednesday this week by default if this utterance
was made on Monday, and this is described in the
additional conditions in Rule (I). After &apos;next week&apos;
is inputted, NP is pushed to the stacks of all con-
texts, resulting in (3a) and (3b). Then Rule (II) is
applied to (3a), making (4b). Rule (I) can be applied
to (4b), and then (4c) is created and is turned into
(4d), which has the highest priority.
Before &apos;next week&apos; is inputted, the interpretation
that the user wants to book a room on Wednesday
this week has the highest priority, and then after
that, the interpretation that the user wants to book
a room on Wednesday next week has the highest

grammar (Noda et al., 1998). This grammar is weak
enough to capture spontaneously spoken utterances,
which sometimes include fillers and self-repairs, and
allows each speech interval to be an arbitrary num-
ber of arbitrary bunsetsu phrases.&apos; The grammar
contains less than one hundred words for each task;
we reduced the vocabulary size so that the speech
recognizer could output results in real time. The
speech recognizer incrementally outputs word hy-
potheses as soon as they are found in the best-scored
path in the forward search (Hirasawa et al., 1998;
Gorz et al., 1996). Since each word hypothesis is
accompanied by the pointer to its preceding word,
the understanding module can reconstruct word se-
quences. The newest word hypothesis determines
the word sequence that is acoustically most likely
at a point in time.2
The utterance understanding module works based
on ISSS and uses a domain-dependent unification
grammar with a context-free backbone that is based
on bunsetsu phrases. This grammar is more re-
strictive than the grammar for speech recognition,
but covers phenomena peculiar to spoken language
such as particle omission and self-repairs. A be-
lief state is represented by a frame (Bobrow et
al., 1977); thus, a speech act representation is a
command for changing the slot value of a frame.
Although a more sophisticated model would be re-
quired for the system to engage in a complicated
dialogue, frame representations are sufficient for our
tasks. The response generation module is invoked
when the user pauses, and plans responses based
on the belief state of the context with the highest
priority. The response strategy is similar to that
of previous frame-based dialogue systems (Bobrow
et al., 1977). The speech production module out-
puts speech according to orders from the response
generation module.

dialogue of a reservation system that was recorded in

pared: one that uses ISSS (system A), and one
that requires each speech interval to be an SU
(an interval-based system, system B). In system B,
when a speech interval was not an SU, the frame
was not changed. The dialogue task was a meet-
ing room reservation. Both systems used the same
speech recognizer and the same grammar. There
were ten subjects and each carried out a task on the
two systems, resulting in twenty dialogues. The
subjects were using the systems for the first time.
They carried out one practice task with system B
beforehand. This experiment was conducted in a
computer terminal room where the machine noise
was somewhat adverse to speech recognition. A
meaningful discussion on the success rate of utter-
ance segmentation is not possible because of the
recognition errors due to the small coverage of the
recognition grammar.3
All subjects successfully completed the task with
system A in an average of 42.5 seconds, and six
subjects did so with system B in an average of
55.0 seconds. Four subjects could not complete
the task in 90 seconds with system B. Five subjects
completed the task with system A 1.4 to 2.2 times
quicker than with system B and one subject com-
pleted it with system B one second quicker than
with system A. A statistical hypothesis test showed
that times taken to carry out the task with system
A are significantly shorter than those with system
B (Z = 3.77, p &lt; .0001).4 The order in which the
subjects used the systems had no significant effect.
In addition, user impressions of system A were
generally better than those of system B. Although
there were some utterances that the system misun-
derstood because of grammar limitations, excluding
the data for the three subjects who had made those
utterances did not change the statistical results.
The reason it took longer to carry out the tasks
3About 50% of user speech intervals were not covered by
the recognition grammar due to the small vocabulary size of the
recognition grammar. For the remaining 50% of the intervals,
the word error rate of recognition was about 20%. The word
error rate is defined as 100 * ( substitutions + deletions
+ insertions ) I ( correct + substitutions + deletions )
(Zechner and Waibel, 1998).

4In this test, we used a kind of censored mean which is
computed by taking the mean of the logarithms of the ratios of
the times only for the subjects that completed the tasks with
both systems. The population distribution was estimated by the
bootstrap method (Cohen, 1995).

with system B is that, compared to system A, the
probability that it understood user utterances was
much lower. This is because the recognition results
of speech intervals do not always form one SU.
About 67% of all recognition results of user speech
intervals were SUs or fillers.5
Needless to say, these results depend on the recog-
nition grammar, the grammar for understanding, the
response strategy and other factors. It has been
suggested, however, that assuming each speech in-
terval to be an utterance unit could reduce system
performance and that ISSS is effective.

6 Concluding Remarks
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999953818181818">
This paper proposed ISSS (incremental significant-
utterance-sequence search), an integrated incremen-
tal parsing and discourse processing method that en-
ables both the understanding of unsegmented user
utterances and real-time responses. This paper also
reported an experimental result which suggested
that ISSS is effective. It is also worthwhile men-
tioning that using ISSS enables building spoken di-
alogue systems with less effort because it is possible
to define significant utterances without considering
where pauses might appear.
